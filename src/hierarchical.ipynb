       "  'Text': 'RAMALLAH/BAGHDAD - Top United States diplomat Antony Blinken said the Palestinian Authority (PA) should play a central role in the future of the Gaza Strip, as he met Iraqi leaders and toured the region amid spiralling tensions over Israel’s war with Hamas.Mr Blinken passed through Israeli checkpoints to meet Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah, then travelled on to Iraq. It was his second visit to the region since the Hamas militants, who rule Gaza, launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 others hostage, according to Israel.Palestinian views, voices and aspirations need to be “at the centre” of conversations about the future of Gaza, Mr Blinken told reporters in Baghdad. As Israel continued a campaign of air strikes that Gaza health officials say has killed 9,770 Palestinians, Secretary of State Blinken rebuffed calls for a ceasefire from Arab officials on Saturday after appealing, unsuccessfully, to Israel for more limited pauses to the fighting a day earlier. “This is a process,” Mr Blinken said about the push for humanitarian pauses, saying Israel has important questions about how they would work, and details are being discussed now. It is important that any pause advance several issues, including hostage release, he said. In discussions with the Iraqi government, Mr Blinken said: “I made very clear that the attacks, the threats coming from militia that are aligned with Iran, are totally unacceptable.” The United States is sending a message to “anyone who might seek to take advantage of the conflict in Gaza to threaten our personnel here or anywhere else in the region: ‘Don’t do it’”, he said.Post-conflict plan  As well as seeking to ensure the conflict does not spread in the region, Mr Blinken is trying to kick-start discussions on how Gaza could be governed, after the complete destruction of Hamas that Israel says is its aim.Mr Abbas told Mr Blinken that Gaza is “an integral part” of the state Palestinians want, according to an account of the meeting from the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, which suggested any PA role in governing Gaza would have to be part of a wider settlement of the decades-old conflict. “We will fully assume our responsibilities within the framework of a comprehensive political solution that includes all of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,” Mr Abbas was quoted by WAFA as saying.The two met for about an hour but did not address the media.“We need to see the US playing the role of an honest mediator, not adopting the Israeli narrative,” head of the Palestinian Mission to the United Kingdom Husam Zomlot told CBS on Sunday.Mr Blinken had some “good ideas” about the future, he said, but “now is the time to... stop the murder of civilians”. Mr Abbas told Mr Blinken there should be an immediate ceasefire and that aid should be allowed into Gaza, according to spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh.Mr Blinken said the United States was committed to getting aid into Gaza and restoring essential services there, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement on the meeting.“The Secretary also expressed the commitment of the United States to working toward the realisation of the Palestinians’ legitimate aspirations for the establishment of a Palestinian state,” Mr Miller said.Troubled authorityMr Blinken has suggested an “effective and revitalized Palestinian Authority” would make the most sense to ultimately run the strip, but admitted that other countries and international agencies would likely play a role in security and governance in the interim.Mr Abbas’ PA, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has seen its popularity shrivel amid allegations of graft, incompetence and widely hated security cooperation arrangements with Israel. It is unclear who will succeed the aging and ailing Mr Abbas, 87, a staunch opponent of Hamas.The foreign ministers of Egypt and Jordan said on Saturday after meeting Mr Blinken that it was premature to talk about the future of Gaza, as they called for an immediate ceasefire to address the humanitarian crisis that has engulfed the strip’s 2.3 million residents.Mr Blinken argued that a ceasefire would only allow Hamas to regroup, but is trying to convince Israel to agree to location-specific pauses that would allow much needed aid to be distributed within Gaza.While Hamas tightly controls besieged Gaza, the West Bank is a complex patchwork of hillside cities, Israeli settlements and army checkpoints that split Palestinian communities.Violence was already at a more than 15-year high in 2023, but has surged further since the war began, with more than 170 attacks on Palestinians involving Jewish settlers recorded by the United Nations.Mr Blinken credited Mr Abbas for tamping down tension in the West Bank and told him he had pressed Israeli officials for accountability, the senior State Department official said.

       " 8: {'Title': 'South Korea take Singapore ‘very, very seriously’, says coach Jurgen Klinsmann ',\n",
       "  'indexes': [249, 1249],\n",
       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Theirs is a battle between David and Goliath.On one side stand South Korea, ranked 24th in the world and third in Asia, who have appeared at the last 10 World Cups, including the previous edition in Qatar last December, when they reached the round of 16. On the other are Singapore, 155th in the world and 31st in Asia, who have never even come close to qualifying for the football showpiece.Furthermore, the Taegeuk Warriors, led by Tottenham Hotspur captain Son Heung-min, will have a capacity crowd of over 66,000 behind them when the teams meet in their Group C World Cup qualifying match at the Seoul World Cup Stadium.So it is no understatement that the hosts are anything but overwhelming favourites on Thursday. And yet, South Korea coach Jurgen Klinsmann is not taking anything for granted. Last week, the German legend and his assistant, former South Korea international Cha Du-ri, made a trip to Singapore to watch the Asian Champions League game between Lion City Sailors and Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors at the Jalan Besar Stadium. Klinsmann, who wanted to have a closer look at Jeonbuk’s South Korea internationals and also the Singapore national players, refused to be drawn on the possibility of his team serving out a lopsided scoreline. In their last competitive ties in 1989, Singapore lost 3-0 home and away during the first round of Asian World Cup qualifiers.When asked if the objective for his team on Thursday was to register a resounding victory, Klinsmann told The Straits Times: “No, no. The aim is very simple, it is to win the game. That is the clear message to the team. “We don’t think that we are superior by any means. We are the favourites but the game starts 0-0. And then anything can happen.” Son echoed his coach’s feelings, saying at a pre-match press conference on Wednesday: “There’s no easy game and we take the game tomorrow as (seriously) as any other game that we (will) ever play.”Klinsmann, who was appointed in February, cited their last outing in October, when they thumped Asean’s highest-ranked side Vietnam 6-0. He said: “We played Vietnam in the last friendly and they had two chances before we scored. And then when it was 2-0, they hit the crossbar with a free kick. So they could have scored two or three goals. “So, we take (Singapore) very, very seriously, with a lot of respect. It starts 0-0 and it will be a lot of work for us. We will not underestimate the Singapore team at all. They have quality players, they know how to play... and we expect a difficult game.”After a shaky start to his tenure, Klinsmann has guided the Taegeuk Warriors to three straight wins in friendly matches. For their upcoming qualifiers, including next Tuesday’s visit to China, Klinsmann has picked his strongest possible squad, featuring 11 Europe-based players, like Lee Kang-in (Paris Saint-Germain), Kim Min-jae (Bayern Munich) and Hwang Hee-chan (Wolverhampton Wanderers).

       "  'Text': 'RAFAH - Palestinian medics evacuated 31 premature babies from Gaza City’s war-torn Al-Shifa hospital on Nov 19 in a high-risk operation, the United Nations said, pledging to also move patients and staff who remain there. The hospital, Gaza’s largest, has been described by the UN’s World Health Organisation (WHO) as a “death zone”, after it sent a team to visit the facility on Nov 18. Director-general of hospitals in Gaza Mohammed Zaqut told AFP “all 31 premature babies in Al-Shifa hospital... have been evacuated” and said “preparations are under way” for them to enter Egypt.It was also confirmed by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PCRS) which said the transfer had been carried out in coordination with United Nations agencies including the WHO.Al-Shifa hospital has become a focal point for Israeli operations, with the army claiming Hamas uses it as a base. Hamas, and medical staff, have denied the accusations.Israel is seeking to destroy the Hamas militants behind the October 7 attacks that Israeli officials say killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw around 240 people taken hostage.The Hamas health authority says Israel’s relentless military campaign has killed more than 12,300 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 31 “very sick” babies were moved out of Al-Shifa hospital in six PCRS ambulances under “extremely intense and high-risk security conditions”. They were taken to a hospital in the southern Gaza city of Rafah where they were “receiving urgent care in the neonatal intensive care unit”, he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, saying they were accompanied by “six health workers and 10 staff family members”.The agency was planning “further missions... to urgently transport remaining patients and health staff out of Al-Shifa Hospital”, he added, once guarantees of safe passage are secured.The WHO’s initial visit to Al-Shifa came after hundreds fled the hospital on Nov 18, following what Al-Shifa’s director said were Israeli army orders for it to be emptied.  Israel denied ordering the move. An AFP journalist at the scene saw crowds of sick, injured and displaced people walking towards the seafront, with the Health Ministry saying 120 patients had stayed behind, among them a number of premature babies. “Many patients can not leave the hospital as they are in the ICU beds or the baby incubators,” Al Shifa’s Dr Ahmed al-Mokhallalati wrote on Nov 18 on X.Following its visit to Al-Shifa, the WHO said 291 patients and 25 health workers were still inside the hospital, figures issued several hours before the babies were evacuated.Since Nov 11, when fuel supplies ran out at Al-Shifa, eight babies have died due to the lack of electricity to run incubator units, the health ministry has said.
