       "  'Text': 'OSLO/STOCKHOLM - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian dissident Alexei Navalny are among favourites for the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize, but experts say campaigners for women, indigenous people or the environment could well steal the stage.Given past form, the Norwegian Nobel Committee is also capable of a complete surprise in the Oct 6 announcement. Though bookmakers have Mr Zelensky as a top candidate to join the illustrious list of laureates from Mr Nelson Mandela to Mr Martin Luther King, Nobel specialists believe that as a wartime leader, the Ukrainian President is unlikely to be named.The imprisoned Navalny’s chances are lessened because Russian dissidents won in 2022 and the year before.A third bookmakers’ favourite is jailed Uighur activist Ilham Tohti, though that would infuriate China. When jailed dissident Liu Xiaobo won the peace prize, Beijing froze diplomatic relations with Oslo for six years.Dr Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said in a year marking the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that the committee may decide to shine a light on the contribution of activists to peace.A prize to Mr Tohti or another activist in China would be a welcome focus on Beijing’s increasingly authoritarian rule, he said.Dr Urdal also cited Iran’s Ms Narges Mohammadi, who campaigns for women’s rights and against the death penalty, and is currently in jail; Afghanistan’s Ms Mahbouba Seraj who, despite a ban from the ruling Taliban, continues to campaign for girls’ rights to education and other women’s rights and remains in Kabul.“I think perhaps the most likely candidates would be human rights defenders,” he said.‘Disintegrating peace’Thousands of people can propose names, including former laureates, Members of Parliament and university professors of history or law. Nominations are secret for 50 years but those who nominate can choose to reveal their choices.The 2022 prize, seen by many as a rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, went to jailed Belarusian activist Ales Bialiatski, Russian rights group Memorial and Ukraine’s Centre for Civil Liberties.The Nobel body may also want to spotlight climate change, a topic the committee last addressed in 2007 in its award to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and former US vice-president Al Gore.“This is a period of disintegrating peace. At the same time, it’s the period when the pressure of a massive ecological crisis is putting its weight on us,” said Dr Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. “Climate change, clearly in some circumstances, leads to more conflict.”Dr Smith cited the Fridays for Future movement, started by Miss Greta Thunberg, as a contender, as well as Chief Raoni Metuktire of the indigeneous Kayapo people in Brazil, who has for decades campaigned to protect the Amazon rainforest. “Indigenous involvement in protecting the environment is really going to be fundamental to our prospects of surviving this current crisis,” he said.Dr Urdal agreed indigenous peoples’ rights could be in focus, citing Ms Victoria Tauli-Corpuz of the Philippines, previously the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and Ecuadorean indigenous leader Juan Carlos Jintiach.Other potential laureates include an international body like the International Court of Justice, the UN refugee agency UNHCR, its children’s fund Unicef, or the International Committee of the Red Cross.

       "  'indexes': [364, 1175],\n",
       "  'Text': 'JAKARTA – President Joko Widodo’s son Gibran Rakabuming Raka, who is running for vice-president in the 2024 presidential polls, completed his studies and earned an advanced diploma and a degree, said the Management Development Institute of Singapore (MDIS) on Nov 23.The school was responding to online chatter in forums and social media platforms where questions were raised about  whether the MDIS qualifications held by Mr Gibran, who is also mayor of Surakarta, or Solo, were legitimate.Mr Gibran, 36, was a full-time student at MDIS from 2007 to 2010, the school said in a press statement. “During this period, he completed an advanced diploma followed by a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in marketing, awarded by our university partner.”  The comments from MDIS came after Mr Gibran, whose father is popularly known as Jokowi, invited journalists to his office in Solo on Nov 20 to show them his academic certificates. “I just consider it funny. I feel bad for my parents who have already put their children through school,” said Mr Gibran then.Netizens had questioned the legitimacy of his qualifications, including whether he had completed his degree in Singapore or elsewhere overseas, including places like Britain or Australia.Earlier reports had stated that Mr Gibran’s degree was obtained from the University of Bradford in Britain.The Straits Times understands that MDIS used to offer a joint programme with that school, from which students would graduate with a diploma from the institute and a degree from the university. MDIS said that in Singapore, private educational institutions conduct tertiary education programmes through joint collaborations with overseas university partners. “MDIS is committed to upholding a high standard of integrity and academic rigour. All diplomas and degrees our esteemed overseas university partners awarded adhere to rigorous academic standards,” it added.The media spotlight for the past month has been focused on Mr Gibran, after it was announced that he would be Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto’s running mate in the upcoming presidential polls.On Nov 13, the pair – backed by Mr Prabowo’s Indonesia Onward Coalition – were formally accepted as candidates for the Feb 14, 2024, election, in which more than 200 million Indonesians are eligible to vote, and are currently seen by many as front runners. This came after Indonesia’s Constitutional Court had in October ruled that the minimum age of 40 to run for the nation’s top posts would not apply to anyone who has held or currently holds a position won through a general election, including regional ballots.Mr Prabowo, 72, and Mr Gibran will be facing off against former Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan, 54, and his running mate, former minister Muhaimin Iskandar, 57, as well as former Central Java governor Ganjar Pranowo, 55, and Chief Security Minister Mahfud MD, 66.

       "  'Text': 'LONDON - Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other on Thursday of moving troops close to their joint border as tensions over the future of the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave rose even as the two countries said they remained committed to a peace process.Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenian authorities, is at the centre of a rancorous standoff, with Azerbaijan restricting movement along the only road to it from Armenia to thwart what it says is arms smuggling.Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Thursday accused Azerbaijan of conducting an “ongoing military build-up along the line of contact in Nagorno-Karabakh and the Armenia-Azerbaijan border”, according to Armenian state news agency Armenpress.Armenia’s foreign ministry, which said Yerevan was not interested in military escalation and was ready to continue efforts to secure a peace deal, said the information had been confirmed by various sources.Azerbaijan’s foreign ministry rejected the Armenian assertion in a statement which called on Yerevan to end what Baku called “military and political provocations.”“These claims are...part of another fraudulent political manipulation,” the foreign ministry said.Mr Hikmet Hajiyev, foreign policy adviser to Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev, told Reuters that Azerbaijan’s armed forces were conducting pre-planned drills in preparation for the autumn and winter.“It’s part of the regular planning process,” said Mr Hajiyev, accusing Armenia in turn of concentrating troops on the border and of purchasing new weaponry systems.He said ethnic Armenian forces inside Nagorno-Karabakh had also come out of their regular barracks and deployed to front line positions in what he said was a high level of alertness.Armenia did not comment on its own troop movements.“Our strategy is about deterrence and deterring any armed or illegal military actions or provocations against Azerbaijan,” said Mr Hajiyev.Russia, which has maintained peacekeepers in the region since a 2020 war in which Azerbaijan seized back significant amounts of territory it had lost to Armenian forces in the 1990s, said on Thursday it was continuing to fulfil its role as a security guarantor in the South Caucasus.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov criticised Armenia’s decision to host a joint exercise involving 85 US soldiers next week as unhelpful however.“In this situation, holding such exercises does not contribute to stabilising the situation in any case and strengthening the atmosphere of mutual trust in the region,” Mr Peskov said.“But Russia continues to fulfil its functions as a guarantor of security, Russia continues scrupulous, consistent and constructive work with both Yerevan and Baku.” REUTERS'}}"
