       "  'indexes': [443, 1710],\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM – Israel’s military said it was ready to evacuate babies from Gaza’s largest hospital on Sunday, where Palestinian officials said two newborns had died and dozens more were at risk after fuel ran out amid intense fighting in the area.As the humanitarian situation worsened, Gaza’s border authority announced that the Rafah crossing into Egypt would reopen on Sunday for foreign passport holders, after being closed on Friday. Jordan also airdropped more aid into a field hospital in the enclave.Hamas said it had completely or partially destroyed more than 160 Israeli military targets in Gaza, including more than 27 tanks and vehicles in the past 48 hours. An Israeli military spokesperson said Hamas had lost control of northern Gaza.At a news conference late on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the deaths of five more Israeli soldiers in Gaza. The Israeli military said 46 had been killed since its ground operations there began.Israel said rockets were still being fired from Gaza into southern Israel, where it has said about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 others taken hostage by Hamas in October.Palestinian officials said on Friday that 11,078 Gaza residents had been killed in air and artillery strikes since Oct 7, around 40 per cent of them children.Reports of possible hostage dealIsrael’s three major television news channels, without citing named sources, said there was some progress towards a deal to free hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said he would not discuss details of any possible deal, which according to N12 News would involve 50 to 100 women, children and elderly people being released in stages during a three- to five-day pause in fighting.According to the reports, Israel would release women and minor Palestinian prisoners and consider letting fuel in to Gaza, while reserving the right to resume fighting.In Tel Aviv, thousands joined a rally to support families of the hostages.Gaza residents said Israeli troops, who went to war to eliminate Hamas after its deadly cross-border assault on Oct 7, had been clashing with Hamas gunmen all night in and around Gaza City where the Al Shifa hospital is located.Mr Ashraf Al-Qidra, who represents the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza, said the hospital suspended operations after fuel ran out. He said two babies had died in an incubator as a result, adding that there were 45 babies in total.“We are using all and primitive means to try not to lose more lives,” he said. “But unless a solution is found to provide us with fuel or electricity the patients and injured are at risk of death.”He said Israeli shelling killed a patient in intensive care and that Israeli snipers on rooftops fired into the medical complex from time to time, limiting people’s ability to move.“We have not been informed about any mechanism to get the babies out to a safer hospital. So far we are praying for their safety and not to lose more of them,” added Mr Al-Qidra.The World Health Organisation expressed “grave concern” for the safety of everyone trapped in the hospital by the fighting and said it had lost communications with its contacts there.Israel says it will help evacuate babiesIsrael’s chief military spokesman, Rear-Admiral Daniel Hagari, said the Israeli military would help evacuate babies from the hospital, at the request of the staff at Al Shifa.Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, the hospital’s director, told Al Jazeera TV that protecting patients was the priority.“We contacted the Red Cross and informed them we ran out of water, oxygen, fuel and everything,” Dr Abu Salmiya said.“The premature babies, patients in intensive care and even wounded people couldn’t survive with the lack of electricity... If the occupation forces want to evacuate the wounded people to any place in the world that is safer than the Gaza Strip, we are not against that.”Israel has said doctors, patients and thousands of evacuees who have taken refuge at hospitals in northern Gaza must leave, so it can tackle Hamas gunmen who it says have placed command centres under and around them.Hamas denies using hospitals this way. Medical staff say patients could die if they are moved and Palestinian officials say Israeli fire makes it dangerous for others to leave.Israeli Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter called the evacuations “Gaza’s Nakba” – a reference to mass dispossession of Palestinians after Israel was founded in 1948.“Operationally, there’s no way to conduct a war the way the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) wants to conduct it inside Gaza territories,” Mr Dichter said. “I don’t know how it will end.”‘Totally a war zone’Dr Ahmed al-Mokhallalati, a senior plastic surgeon at Al Shifa, told Reuters there had been continuous bombardment for more than 24 hours. He said most hospital staff and people sheltering there had left, but 500 patients remained.“It’s totally a war zone. It’s a totally scary atmosphere here in the hospital,” he said.The military wing of Hamas ally Islamic Jihad, the Al-Quds Brigades, said it was “engaged in violent clashes in the vicinity of Al Shifa Medical Complex, Al Nasr neighbourhood, and Al Shati camp in Gaza”.Al Nasr is home to several major hospitals.Israel said earlier it had killed what it called a Hamas “terrorist” whom it said had prevented the evacuation of another hospital in the north, which Palestinian officials have said is out of service and surrounded by tanks.It said Ahmed Siam was killed along with other militants while hiding in the Al Buraq school. Palestinian officials told Reuters on Friday that at least 25 Palestinians had been killed in an Israeli strike at the school, which was packed with evacuees.In London, at least 300,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched and police arrested more than 120 people as they sought to stop far-right counter-protesters from ambushing the rally. More than 20,000 people joined a pro-Palestinian rally in Brussels.Meeting in Saudi Arabia, Muslim and Arab countries called for an immediate end to military operations in Gaza, rejecting Israel’s justification of self-defence. A communique issued at the summit urged the International Criminal Court to investigate “war crimes and crimes against humanity that Israel is committing”. REUTERS'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'NANNING - To maintain peace and stability, Malaysia and China have agreed to have continual, open communication over the South China Sea issue, Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said after his meeting with China Premier Li Qiang in Nanning, China, on Sunday. Datuk Seri Anwar was in the southern Chinese city for a packed 14-hour visit, reported Bernama news agency.Mr Anwar attended the 20th China-Asean Expo, where he introduced Malaysia’s jackfruit to the Chinese market, as well as the China-Asean Business and Investment Summit. He also witnessed the signing of three memoranda of understanding worth close to RM20 billion (S$5.8 billion), and had closed-door meetings with tech giant\\xa0Huawei and China Communications Construction Company. According to Xinhua news agency, Mr Li said China stands ready to work more closely with Malaysia to maintain peace in the South China Sea, safeguard the Asean-centred regional cooperation framework, and advance the China-Asean Free Trade Area 3.0 negotiations to facilitate regional economic integration. During their bilateral meeting at Li Yuan Resort, the two leaders also discussed the situation in Myanmar and the repatriation of Rohingya refugees. “Premier Li shared the concept of a community for a shared future for mankind, which stresses principles of openness, civility, inclusiveness and mutual respect in dealing with bilateral, regional and international cooperation,” Mr Anwar said in a statement issued on Saturday.“These values are consistent with those of Malaysia Madani,” he added. In January, Mr Anwar unveiled the Malaysia Madani slogan, which he said will bring the country forward, noting that the word Madani encompasses values including sustainability, care and compassion, respect, innovation, prosperity and trust.He also invited Mr Li and Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit Malaysia in 2024 to commemorate five decades of diplomatic relations between the countries, reported Bernama. “The 50th anniversary of Malaysia-China diplomatic relations is being planned together, and various activities will be held in Malaysia and China.“Once again, I extend an invitation to Xi and Li to hold an official visit to Malaysia next year in conjunction with that celebration,” Mr Anwar said.Mr Li said China will take the anniversary as a chance to work with Malaysia to pass on and deepen the friendship between both countries from generation to generation, reported Xinhua. He added that China is ready to work on flagship China-Malaysia cooperation projects such as the “Two Countries, Twin Parks” and the East Coast Rail Link, while exploring bilateral collaborations in other areas.

       "  'indexes': [467, 1826],\n",
       "  'Text': 'MONTEVIDEO – Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni has backed his team to recover in time for the Nov 21 showdown with Brazil, after both South American giants suffered shock World Cup qualifying defeats on Nov 16.Uruguay ended Argentina’s 14-match unbeaten streak with a 2-0 away victory over the world champions, as Luis Diaz scored twice to fire Colombia to an emotional 2-1 home win over Brazil.Defender Ronald Araujo fired the Uruguayans ahead on 41 minutes. Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez then sealed victory with an 87th-minute goal to settle a hard-fought clash at the Bombonera Stadium in Buenos Aires. “There is a very difficult game coming up and we will try to do our best. I think this team has shown plenty of times that it can get out of difficult situations,” Scaloni said.“We lose and win as a team, and there are times when you have to give credit to the opponent. We can’t think that because we’re world champions, we can’t lose. We are not unbeatable – I’ve said it before and will continue to say it.”It was Argentina’s first defeat of the 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign, and their first loss since they were stunned 2-1 by Saudi Arabia at the 2022 Finals in Qatar.“We never felt comfortable,” captain Lionel Messi said after the defeat.“They’re a physical team that works well and on the counter-attack they were very dangerous,” added Messi, praising the work of Uruguay’s revered Argentinian coach Marcelo Bielsa.“You can see his influence on the team. In all the teams he’s been involved in, including Argentina, you can see his influence.”Argentina, who had won all four of their previous qualifiers, remain on top of the standings with 12 points from five matches. Uruguay’s win leaves them in second place on 10 points.Nunez’s Liverpool teammate Diaz, meanwhile, scored two goals in five minutes as Colombia came from behind to stun Brazil 2-1 in Barranquilla.Diaz’s dramatic double capped a roller-coaster month for the forward, whose father was taken hostage by Colombian guerrillas at the end of October before being released on Nov 9. His father, Luis Manuel Diaz, was watching from the stands in tears as his son scored in the 75th and 79th minutes.Diaz’s double cancelled out Brazil’s opener, which came from Arsenal forward Gabriel Martinelli after only four minutes.“I’m grateful to my teammates, to the coaching staff who were always there for me at every moment. And I dedicate the victory to the people, who deserved it,” said Diaz.Colombia moved up to third place after the win with nine points from five games. Brazil are fifth, behind Venezuela. AFP'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'BEIJING - China’s top spy agency published new details this week about a US citizen jailed for life for espionage earlier this year, describing his recruitment by US agents, how they fabricated his legend, and how he helped them entrap surveillance targets. When a court in eastern China jailed 78-year-old John Shing-wan Leung to life in May, it ended his more than three decades-long career as an “American spy”, the Ministry of State Security wrote in a statement on its official WeChat account on Monday titled Prominent American Spy Captured In China! Born in Hong Kong, Leung went to the United States in 1983 to run a restaurant, before being \"formally\" recruited as an informant by an unnamed US spy agency in 1989, and in the same year became a US citizen, the ministry\\'s statement said.Leung was promised US$1,000 a month as well as bonuses for intelligence and a false “persona” was created to polish his “social image” to help him get close to Chinese institutions and individuals in the US, the ministry said.This false story included attending university in the United Kingdom, holding a position in the United Nations and serving in the Vietnam War. The ministry said Leung was also instructed to make donations to charities and US state legislators “to raise his profile”.Using this cover, the ministry said, Leung attended meals and festivals, and helped organise immigrant group activities to gather intelligence on Chinese nationals and overseas Chinese in the US.He also brought targeted people to restaurants and hotels where surveillance devices were installed with the aim of extracting information they spilled or entrapping them.According to the security ministry, Leung was directed to go to China by his US handlers in 2020, when the pandemic restrictions made entry to the country difficult. Then 75 years old, Leung “used multiple identity documents to transit through Hong Kong and arrived in mainland China”  late that year, it said.“Under the guidance of several American spies, Liang Chengyun collected a significant amount of intelligence related to China,” the statement said, using his Chinese name, adding that he was given a “Meritorious Service Medal” by US intelligence agencies.The US embassy in Beijing did not immediately reply to a request for comment.The Chinese ministry did not explain in the WeChat post why it chose to share details months after Leung’s conviction, but it has been conducting a national security publicity campaign with a stated aim of rooting out foreign spies.In addition, the ministry’s official WeChat account only went live in August.The release of the ministry’s report on Leung coincided with a media storm in the United Kingdom after The Times of London published details about the arrest of a British parliamentary researcher suspected of spying for China.In August, China separately released details of two investigations into Chinese nationals accused of spying for the US Central Intelligence Agency.In its statement on Leung, the security ministry warned that anyone who joins an espionage organisation or accepts jobs via agents should be sentenced to at least 10 years in prison.The foreign business and diplomatic community in China has become more guarded following the expansion of Beijing\\'s anti-spying law earlier this year.

       "{'Title': 'Israel offers to evacuate babies from crippled Gaza hospital after 2 newborns die as fuel runs out',\n",
       " 'indexes': [443, 1710],\n",
       " 'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM – Israel’s military said it was ready to evacuate babies from Gaza’s largest hospital on Sunday, where Palestinian officials said two newborns had died and dozens more were at risk after fuel ran out amid intense fighting in the area.As the humanitarian situation worsened, Gaza’s border authority announced that the Rafah crossing into Egypt would reopen on Sunday for foreign passport holders, after being closed on Friday. Jordan also airdropped more aid into a field hospital in the enclave.Hamas said it had completely or partially destroyed more than 160 Israeli military targets in Gaza, including more than 27 tanks and vehicles in the past 48 hours. An Israeli military spokesperson said Hamas had lost control of northern Gaza.At a news conference late on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the deaths of five more Israeli soldiers in Gaza. The Israeli military said 46 had been killed since its ground operations there began.Israel said rockets were still being fired from Gaza into southern Israel, where it has said about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 others taken hostage by Hamas in October.Palestinian officials said on Friday that 11,078 Gaza residents had been killed in air and artillery strikes since Oct 7, around 40 per cent of them children.Reports of possible hostage dealIsrael’s three major television news channels, without citing named sources, said there was some progress towards a deal to free hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.Mr Netanyahu said he would not discuss details of any possible deal, which according to N12 News would involve 50 to 100 women, children and elderly people being released in stages during a three- to five-day pause in fighting.According to the reports, Israel would release women and minor Palestinian prisoners and consider letting fuel in to Gaza, while reserving the right to resume fighting.In Tel Aviv, thousands joined a rally to support families of the hostages.Gaza residents said Israeli troops, who went to war to eliminate Hamas after its deadly cross-border assault on Oct 7, had been clashing with Hamas gunmen all night in and around Gaza City where the Al Shifa hospital is located.Mr Ashraf Al-Qidra, who represents the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza, said the hospital suspended operations after fuel ran out. He said two babies had died in an incubator as a result, adding that there were 45 babies in total.“We are using all and primitive means to try not to lose more lives,” he said. “But unless a solution is found to provide us with fuel or electricity the patients and injured are at risk of death.”He said Israeli shelling killed a patient in intensive care and that Israeli snipers on rooftops fired into the medical complex from time to time, limiting people’s ability to move.“We have not been informed about any mechanism to get the babies out to a safer hospital. So far we are praying for their safety and not to lose more of them,” added Mr Al-Qidra.The World Health Organisation expressed “grave concern” for the safety of everyone trapped in the hospital by the fighting and said it had lost communications with its contacts there.Israel says it will help evacuate babiesIsrael’s chief military spokesman, Rear-Admiral Daniel Hagari, said the Israeli military would help evacuate babies from the hospital, at the request of the staff at Al Shifa.Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, the hospital’s director, told Al Jazeera TV that protecting patients was the priority.“We contacted the Red Cross and informed them we ran out of water, oxygen, fuel and everything,” Dr Abu Salmiya said.“The premature babies, patients in intensive care and even wounded people couldn’t survive with the lack of electricity... If the occupation forces want to evacuate the wounded people to any place in the world that is safer than the Gaza Strip, we are not against that.”Israel has said doctors, patients and thousands of evacuees who have taken refuge at hospitals in northern Gaza must leave, so it can tackle Hamas gunmen who it says have placed command centres under and around them.Hamas denies using hospitals this way. Medical staff say patients could die if they are moved and Palestinian officials say Israeli fire makes it dangerous for others to leave.Israeli Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter called the evacuations “Gaza’s Nakba” – a reference to mass dispossession of Palestinians after Israel was founded in 1948.“Operationally, there’s no way to conduct a war the way the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) wants to conduct it inside Gaza territories,” Mr Dichter said. “I don’t know how it will end.”‘Totally a war zone’Dr Ahmed al-Mokhallalati, a senior plastic surgeon at Al Shifa, told Reuters there had been continuous bombardment for more than 24 hours. He said most hospital staff and people sheltering there had left, but 500 patients remained.“It’s totally a war zone. It’s a totally scary atmosphere here in the hospital,” he said.The military wing of Hamas ally Islamic Jihad, the Al-Quds Brigades, said it was “engaged in violent clashes in the vicinity of Al Shifa Medical Complex, Al Nasr neighbourhood, and Al Shati camp in Gaza”.Al Nasr is home to several major hospitals.Israel said earlier it had killed what it called a Hamas “terrorist” whom it said had prevented the evacuation of another hospital in the north, which Palestinian officials have said is out of service and surrounded by tanks.It said Ahmed Siam was killed along with other militants while hiding in the Al Buraq school. Palestinian officials told Reuters on Friday that at least 25 Palestinians had been killed in an Israeli strike at the school, which was packed with evacuees.In London, at least 300,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched and police arrested more than 120 people as they sought to stop far-right counter-protesters from ambushing the rally. More than 20,000 people joined a pro-Palestinian rally in Brussels.Meeting in Saudi Arabia, Muslim and Arab countries called for an immediate end to military operations in Gaza, rejecting Israel’s justification of self-defence. A communique issued at the summit urged the International Criminal Court to investigate “war crimes and crimes against humanity that Israel is committing”. REUTERS'}"
