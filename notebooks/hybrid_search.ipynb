       "  'Title': 'The nightmare of delivering aid during this Israel-Hamas war',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The 2.3 million people who live in Gaza are facing economic isolation and experiencing incessant bombardment. Their supplies of essential resources, including food and water, are quickly dwindling.In response, US President Joe Biden has pledged US$100 million (S$136 million) in humanitarian assistance for the citizens of Gaza.Mr Biden’s promise raises fundamental questions regarding the delivery of humanitarian aid in a war zone. Political constraints, ethical quandaries and the need to protect the security of aid workers and local communities always make the effort a logistical nightmare.In this specific predicament, US officials have to choose a strategy to deliver the aid without the perception of benefiting Hamas, a group the US and Israel both classify as a terrorist organisation.LogisticsWhen aiding people in war zones, you can’t just send money, a development strategy called “cash transfers” that has become increasingly popular due to its efficiency. Sending money can boost the supply of locally produced goods and services, and help people on the ground pay for what they need most. But injecting cash into an economy so completely cut off from the world would only stoke inflation.So the aid must consist of goods that have to be brought into Gaza, and services provided by people working as part of an aid mission. Humanitarian aid can include food and water; health, sanitation and hygiene supplies and services; and tents and other materials for shelter and settlement.Due to the closure of the border with Israel, aid can arrive in Gaza only via the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border.The US Agency for International Development, or USAid, will likely turn to its long-time partner on the ground, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, to serve as supply depots and distribute goods. That agency, originally founded in 1949 as a temporary measure until a two-state solution could be found, serves in effect as a parallel yet unelected government for Palestinian refugees.USAid will likely want to tap into UNRWA’s network of 284 schools – many of which are now transformed into humanitarian shelters housing two-thirds of the estimated one million people displaced by Israeli air strikes – and 22 hospitals to expedite distribution.PoliticsPrior to the Trump administration, the US was typically the largest single provider of aid to the West Bank and Gaza. USAid administers the lion’s share of it.Since Mr Biden took office, total yearly US assistance for the Palestinian territories has totalled around US$150 million, restored from just US$8 million in 2020 under the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, however, the US was providing more aid to the territories than it is now, with US$1 billion disbursed in the 2013 fiscal year.But the White House needs Congress to approve this assistance – a process that requires the House of Representatives to elect a new Speaker and then for lawmakers to approve aid to Gaza once that happens.EthicsThe UNRWA is a UN organisation. It is not run by Hamas, unlike, for instance, the Gaza Ministry of Health. However, Hamas has frequently undermined UNRWA’s efforts and diverted international aid for military purposes.  Hamas has repeatedly used UNRWA schools as rocket depots. It has repeatedly tunnelled beneath UNRWA schools. It has dismantled European Union-funded water pipes to use as rocket fuselages. And even since the most recent violence broke out, the UNRWA has accused Hamas of stealing fuel and food from its Gaza premises.Humanitarian aid professionals regularly have to contend with these trade-offs when deciding to what extent they can work with governments and local authorities that commit violent acts. They need to do so in exchange for the access required to help civilians under their control.Similarly, Mr Biden has had to make concessions to Israel while brokering for the freedom to send humanitarian aid to Gaza. For example, he has assured Israel that if any of the aid is diverted by Hamas, the operation will cease.This promise may have been politically necessary. But if Mr Biden already believes Hamas to be uncaring about civilian welfare, he may not expect the group to refrain from taking what it can.Security best practicesWhat can be done to protect the security of humanitarian aid operations that take place in the midst of dangerous conflicts?Under international humanitarian law, the local authorities have the primary responsibility for ensuring the delivery of aid – even when they aren’t carrying out that task. To increase the chances that the local authorities will not attack them, aid groups can give “humanitarian notification” and voluntarily alert the local government as to where they will be operating.Hamas has repeatedly flouted international norms and laws. So the question of if and how the aid convoy will be protected looms large.Under the current agreement between the US, Israel and Egypt, the convoy will raise the UN flag. International inspectors will make sure no weapons are on board the vehicles before they cross over from Arish, Egypt, to Rafah, a city located on the Gaza Strip’s border with Egypt.The aid convoy will likely cross without militarised security. This puts it at some danger of diversion once inside Gaza. But whether the aid convoy is attacked, seized or left alone, the Biden administration will have demonstrated its willingness to attempt a humanitarian relief operation. In this sense, a relatively small first convoy bearing water, medical supplies and food, among other items, serves as a test balloon for a sustained operation to follow soon after.If the US were to provide the humanitarian convoy a military escort, by contrast, Hamas could see its presence as a provocation. Washington’s support for Israel is so strong that the US could potentially be judged as a party in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.In that case, the presence of US armed forces might provoke attacks on Gaza-bound aid convoys by Hamas  fighters that otherwise would not have occurred. Combined with the mobilisation of two US Navy carrier groups in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, I’d be concerned that such a move might also stoke regional anger. It would undermine the Biden administration’s attempts to cool the situation.On UN-approved missions, aid delivery may be secured by third-party peacekeepers – meaning, in this case, personnel who are neither Israeli nor Palestinian – with the UN Security Council’s blessing. In this case, tragically, it is unlikely that such a resolution could conceivably pass such a vote, much less quickly enough to make a difference.Topher L.

       "  'Title': 'Palestinian Americans fundraise for Gaza, as aid groups receive record donations',\n",
       "  'Text': 'NEW YORK – Palestinian Americans and aid groups in the United States are raising funds for Gaza, which faces a deepening humanitarian crisis as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth week – but they have as yet limited ability to get supplies into the besieged enclave.Aid organisations that serve civilians in Gaza say they are receiving record amounts of donations in a sign of public support for relief efforts, even as a growing stock of supplies remains stalled at Egypt’s Rafah border crossing.In the Gaza Strip, where 2.3 million people live, civilians are in dire need of clean water, food and medicine, emergency medics say. Half of Gaza’s population was already living in poverty before the crisis.“We’ve seen a significant increase in donations, unlike (anything) we’ve ever seen before,” said Mr Steve Sosebee, president of the US-based Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which has a staff headcount of 40 in Gaza, who provide medical support.He said the fund, which usually has an annual budget of around US$12 million (S$16.45 million), had raised US$15 million in just 10 days.However, with a web of political and logistical obstacles on getting aid in, much of the money and supplies intended for Gaza is in limbo, forcing aid groups to wait as they amass truckloads of goods.Hamas militants burst over the Gaza border and rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people and taking 229 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.In response, Israel launched its most intense air bombardment campaign on the tiny enclave, along with a “total siege”, banning food, water and fuel imports.Aid groups say they are building up supplies in hopes of eventually getting them through to civilians in Gaza, nearly half of whom are children.There has been “a five-fold increase in the total number of donors versus typical past emergencies”, said Mr Derek Madsen, chief development\\xa0officer of Anera, a non-partisan emergency relief group for refugees throughout the Middle East.The organisation, which maintains the privacy of individual donors, said it had recently received the largest single donation from an individual in its 55-year history.The majority of support comes from donors based in the US, he added, with individual donations averaging around US$138. The efforts mirror those of Jewish groups in the US and Canada, who also fundraised millions for Israel.Anera was using the last of its stocks this week to distribute meals and vegetable parcels in Gaza. Its staff of 12, like everyone in Gaza, were facing “unbelievable, unimaginable trauma”, he said.Glued to the televisionIn Ann Arbor, Michigan, Ms Rabia Shafie, national director of the Palestine Aid Society, said her group was speaking to student and Muslim groups on local university campuses and community centres to spread awareness and raise donations for the Red Crescent and UNRWA, the United Nations aid agency that serves Palestinian refugees.“The money is needed to help people survive at this point of time. Medical support is so essential,” she said.“People are glued to the television... watching the news moment to moment, and very stressed out over the situation,” said Ms Rabia, adding that it was difficult as a Palestinian American to watch “the massacre and injustice done to our people back home”.Hamas-governed Gaza is one of the most densely packed places on Earth, and its medical authorities say over 8,000 Palestinians have been killed since air strikes began, including more than 3,000 children.Mr Madsen called for a ceasefire and establishment of a humanitarian corridor “so that people literally do not starve to death, literally do not die of dehydration”.Last week, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, home to one of New York’s largest Muslim and Arab communities, hundreds of protesters called for a ceasefire with signs written in Arabic, Spanish, Hebrew and Korean.In Clifton, New Jersey, the Palestinian American Community Centre’s priorities are calling for US officials to support a ceasefire, and the hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza, said Ms Basma Bsharat, the education director of the centre.The centre has also been collecting cash donations to send on to UNRWA. It has asked people not to donate supplies, which it has no easy way of sending to those in need in Gaza.Last week, a woman came to the centre anyway, hauling bags filled with goods.  “We didn’t know how to say no,” said Ms Basma. “She was like, I just want to do something. I just want to help somehow.”“It’s a very difficult time, and the fact that we do see the support coming in it, it gives some relief,” she said. “It gives some kind of solace.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Scaling up Gaza aid effort faces tangle of challenges',\n",
       "  'Text': 'CAIRO - With a trickle of aid flowing into the besieged Gaza Strip from Egypt, humanitarian staff and diplomats face a web of political, security and logistical obstacles as they try to build up and sustain deliveries of relief.The aid is desperately needed. Supplies of food, water, medicines and fuel have been running critically low for Gaza\\'s 2.3 million people since Israel began its bombardment and \"total siege\" of the Palestinian enclave.Israel’s action is in retaliation for an attack by Hamas militants on Oct 7. But Israel\\'s conditions for inspecting and tracking the aid, security risks transporting and distributing it, and arrangement of its passage through a crossing not used during previous conflicts for large-scale relief efforts have all hampered work to get the operation off the ground.Aid began flowing through Rafah, the main exit and entry point for Gaza that does not border Israel, on Oct 21, with up to 20 trucks crossing daily since. United Nations officials say 100 trucks are required daily to meet essential needs.During past conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, aid had mainly been delivered through crossing points with Israel.The UN aid operation for the Palestinian territories has been run through Israel since the 1950s.Now aid needs to be brought in from Egypt\\'s Sinai Peninsula, an isolated region with a recent history of insurgent attacks and a heavily militarised border. \"It\\'s a huge, huge undertaking to set up a humanitarian operation\\xa0from\\xa0scratch,\" said one aid official who asked not to be named. \"We\\'re not set up like that, not even close, from the\\xa0Egyptian\\xa0side.\"BottlenecksThe aid operation was brokered in talks involving the United States, Israel and Egypt, with a deal to start with a convoy of 20 trucks clinched during a visit by US President Joe Biden to Israel last week, aid officials and diplomats say.As it began, details of an inspection system were still being worked out.Scaling up aid required a quick and light system based on random checks, such as that used for sending aid from Turkey into north-western Syria, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said.Trucks are currently driving more than 40km south along the Egypt-Israel border to be inspected before returning to Gaza.This means a lag of several hours between their entry into the crossing on the Egyptian side and their exit into Gaza. \"There are bottlenecks,\" said Ms Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, which brought some supplies into Gaza with the first convoys but has many more waiting on the Egyptian side of the border.\"What exactly are these bottlenecks? It\\'s very unclear, but I think a lot of it is basically, probably the inspection mechanism and the ability of movement inside Gaza,\" she said.Some Gaza bakeries the WFP works with have been put out of operation because of shortages of fuel, a commodity that has so far not been allowed to cross because of Israeli concerns that it could be used by Hamas.Fuel is also crucial for hospital generators and water supplies, and is fast running out.    US Special Envoy David Satterfield, who has been negotiating with Israel, Egypt and the UN to set up sustained aid deliveries, told MSNBC on Oct 22 that while the critical role of fuel was understood, the provision of food, water and medicine would continue to be the focus \"in the immediate future\".Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.BattlefieldThe US, along with other countries, has also been negotiating to get thousands of foreign passport holders out of Gaza through Rafah.Qatar has meanwhile been leading efforts for the release of hostages taken by Hamas militants during the Oct 7 attack.Two Egyptian security sources linked scaling up of aid to Hamas\\'s willingness to free hostages. From a total of more than 200 hostages, two were freed through Rafah late on Monday, with Hamas crediting Qatar and Egypt for their mediation. Two others were released last week.  The UN says delivery of aid should be unconditional.  On the Gaza side of the border, distribution will depend on the pattern of the conflict and mass displacement of residents, which could be further complicated by an expected Israeli ground operation. As intense bombardment continues, aid organisations have appealed for a humanitarian pause or ceasefire to deliver relief. Security guarantees, especially for northern Gaza where Israeli bombing is concentrated, had not been forthcoming, said Mr Rick Brennan, emergencies director for the World Health Organization. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says 35 of its staff have been killed in Gaza since Oct 7.Bombardment has damaged roads and buildings around Rafah. Not long after Sunday\\'s convoy of trucks entered the crossing, shelling from an Israeli tank hit an Egyptian position nearby, wounding several Egyptian border guards. Israel said the incident was an accident.\"We\\'re going to have to adapt the whole logistics of the operation according to what is transpiring on the battlefield,\" said Mr Griffiths. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – As part of efforts to help the victims of the conflict in Gaza, the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) will be sending US$200,000 (S$273,000) worth of relief supplies to the war zone.The SRC said on Tuesday that the relief supplies will include items such as hygiene kits, clean water, food provisions, and medical consumables and equipment such as wheelchairs.The SRC has also deployed a staff member to Cairo, Egypt, to work with the Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC) in identifying immediate and critical needs in Gaza, and to facilitate the delivery of relief supplies in the coming days.The SRC and ERC are working closely to coordinate humanitarian aid into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing – the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.They are also scaling up efforts to provide more humanitarian assistance, the SRC said.Food, water and medical supplies have been coming through the Egyptian border, but the provided aid is simply too small to meet the huge needs on the ground, according to reports.Affected communities in the Gaza Strip have received limited humanitarian aid, said the SRC statement, adding that the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has been working under “challenging conditions” to deliver emergency assistance such as ambulance and healthcare services.“There are severe shortages of essential necessities such as fuel, water and food, while medical supplies are depleting rapidly,” said the SRC.“While some humanitarian aid has arrived in Gaza with support from the ERC and PRCS, it remains inadequate to meet the extensive needs.”SRC chief executive Benjamin William said: “We are deeply concerned about the suffering and anguish experienced by the people in Gaza. Families, children, women and the elderly are enduring unimaginable hardships.”Many victims have to walk long distances to reach safe areas and have no access to basic necessities such as shelter and water, he said.He added that damaged infrastructure and a “communication paralysis” have exacerbated the crisis, leaving victims disconnected from the outside world.“We continue to urge all parties involved to uphold their responsibilities as outlined in international humanitarian law, and prioritise the protection of civilians,” said Mr William, adding that it is important for hospitals, doctors, nurses and humanitarian workers to be protected as well.“It is essential that all parties recognise and enable unhindered critical humanitarian aid into Gaza for all the affected communities, including those who have been displaced.” Two weeks ago, the SRC launched a public fund-raising appeal for relief and recovery operations, which will close on Jan 31, 2024.The organisation earlier pledged US$150,000 to relief efforts, while the Singapore Government contributed $300,000 towards relief operations through the SRC.Members of the public who wish to make an online donation can visit redcross.sg/gazaresponse',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Singapore supports humanitarian aid, calls for civilian lives to be protected in Gaza',\n",
       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Singapore has expressed its support for the efforts of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to sustain the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and calls for all innocent civilian lives to be protected, said Singapore’s Ambassador to the UN Burhan Gafoor.“At the outset, I wish to express Singapore’s utmost support for the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to sustain the flow of humanitarian assistance to the civilians affected by this terrible tragedy in Gaza,” said Mr Gafoor.“We commend the Secretary-General for his leadership role in facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance and recognise the important contributions made by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations on the ground,” he noted.He added that Singapore supports all efforts to defuse tensions in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict.“Respect for the UN Charter and for international law has always been a fundamental guiding principle of Singapore’s foreign policy. The UN Charter and international law provide the foundation for international peace and security,” Mr Gafoor said.The ambassador made these comments at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, as Singapore voted in support of a resolution drafted by Arab states calling for an immediate humanitarian truce.The non-binding resolution received 121 votes in favour, while 44 abstained and 14 – including Israel and the United States – voted “no”. Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s retaliatory action has killed more than 7,000 people in Gaza, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry. Mr Gafoor said: “We mourn the loss and suffering of so many innocent civilians, including children and the elderly. This attack (by Hamas) cannot be condoned or justified by any rationale. We condemn this terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms. We also call for the immediate and safe release of all hostages taken by Hamas.“In this regard, it is worth recalling that just in June this year, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,” he noted. This, he said, calls for the international community to reiterate its “strong and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes”.Israel has the legitimate right to defend its citizens and its territory under international law, said Mr Gafoor.However, he also pointed out that Israel also has an obligation to comply with international humanitarian law.\\xa0“All parties must abide by international humanitarian law and do their utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians,” said the ambassador.He added that Singapore welcomes all efforts to establish and uphold safe zones and routes that will keep civilians out of harm’s way and allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. “Singapore is deeply saddened by the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the loss of so many civilian lives. This is a massive humanitarian crisis,” said Mr Gafoor.“We urge all parties involved to allow the rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and essential services to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” he added. To support humanitarian relief operations in Gaza, the Government has made a financial contribution through the Singapore Red Cross, said Mr Gafoor. Many Singaporeans have also made their own contributions to relief operations, he said, noting that it is the Republic’s hope that their contributions will reach those in need quickly. On the resolution, Mr Gafoor said that Singapore has voted in favour after very careful consideration, but added that the Republic deeply regrets that this resolution has “two glaring and significant omissions”. “First, it makes no mention of Hamas’ role in perpetrating the massive and coordinated terror attacks, which led to the brutal killing of 1,400 Israelis and others and the abduction of more than 200 hostages,” he said.“These are acts of terror that we condemn unequivocally, and the abhorrent deeds of Hamas cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever,” said the ambassador, as he reiterated Singapore’s call for the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all civilians taken hostage. “Second, this resolution\\xa0does not acknowledge Israel’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory in compliance with international law. As with every country, Israel has a right to defend itself from heinous terrorist attacks, to protect its people from senseless violence and to keep its territory secure,” he added.Nevertheless, Singapore supported the resolution as the Republic has “always been a consistent advocate and defender of international law, the UN Charter and the rules-based multilateral system”, said Mr Gafoor.\\xa0\\xa0He pointed out that the resolution reaffirms all parties’ obligations to respect and uphold international law, including international humanitarian law. “It expresses strong support for the efforts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and for his calls for the immediate and unrestricted access of humanitarian aid, and to respond to the most basic needs of the Palestinian civilian population amidst the unfolding humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip,” said Mr Gafoor.The resolution, he said, demands that all parties immediately and fully comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law.\\xa0“These obligations have been spelt out in many UN Security Council resolutions. All innocent civilian lives must be protected,” he stressed.On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr Gafoor said that it is a “longstanding one, and it must be resolved in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. He called it the only way to stop the repeated cycles of violence. “Singapore’s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been consistent. We continue to hold the view that the only viable path to a durable, just and comprehensive solution is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” he said. Mr Gafoor also stressed that Singapore calls on leaders from both sides to show leadership, to exercise restraint and to take the difficult but necessary steps towards the vision of a two-state solution.“We support the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland, and Israel’s right to live within secure borders. Both Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, security and dignity,” he added.',\n",

       "  'Text': 'KHAN YUNIS, Palestinian Territories – At first Mr Youssef Mehna thought the war would quickly be over. Then he was wounded, his house was destroyed, and he was forced to survive “25 days without anything”. So like thousands of others, Mr Mehna finally fled north Gaza for the south.Perched on trucks, crammed into cars, pulled by donkeys on carts, and on foot, tens of thousands of Palestinians are fleeing Israeli army strikes on the territory squeezed between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean.At the Bani Suheila crossroads in Khan Yunis, on the immense Salah Al-Din road that threads Gaza top to bottom, the processions are growing still.People fleeing Gaza City are joined by those leaving Khan Yunis heading further south, towards Rafah, the last city before Egypt.Mr Mehna left the Jabalia refugee camp at seven in the morning, in the north of Gaza City, also hoping to reach Rafah.But his journey finished in Khan Yunis, after eight hours of travel covering only 25km.“I already paid 500 shekels (S$180) to come from Jabalia and so I have nothing more to carry on to Rafah,” he said with a drawn face, surrounded by his six children. Because his sick wife is in a wheelchair, he had to rent “carts pulled by donkeys, trucks, cars” to transport her.Each trip was short as fuel shortages prevent drivers from accepting long-distance fares.Sometimes, between car rides, they were forced to go on foot. “So it was me who pushed my wife’s chair,” he told AFP.Around him, hundreds of families were waiting.Children sleep on the floor beside parents wondering how they will live in a territory where more than 1.5 million people are displaced and nearly one house in two has been destroyed, according to the United Nations.In southern Gaza, overflowing with displaced from the north, rents of US$150 (S$200) a month are now up to US$500 to US$1,000.“I don’t even have a morsel of bread to feed my kids,” said Ms Umm Yaaqub. “Since six in the morning I have been looking everywhere.”“I can’t give them anything to eat,” added the 42-year-old, who arrived in Khan Yunis three days ago with her husband and seven children from Gaza City.The UN has said access to bread in the south is “challenging” because “the only operative mill in Gaza remains unable to grind wheat due to a lack of electricity and fuel”.On Oct 7, Hamas, in power in Gaza, launched an attack on southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians and taking 239 hostages, according to Israel.Since then Israel has been bombing the Gaza Strip and has killed more than 11,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas health ministry.Before the war, a little over 80 per cent of Gazans lived in poverty and almost two-thirds were dependent on international aid, especially for food, according to the UN.Now, 50kg sacks of flour have increased in price from 40 shekels to 150 shekels, so it’s worse still.But hunger is not the only worry for Ms Umm Yaaqub. “My husband has heart problems,” she says.And her 20-year-old daughter, Rim, “is normally in a medical bed”. “But we all sleep on the ground, in the dust, and we don’t have a single blanket even though the nights are very cold.”Her husband, Mr Atef Abu Jarad, 47, remains in a classroom on the first floor of a school where the family camps now, next to dozens of other displaced people.“I’m the head of the family, but I don’t have a single shekel to buy something for my kids to eat,” he laments.Shops across southern Gaza are running out of everything. Bottled water, milk for children, nappies, pasta and juices are now nearly impossible to find.A little food aid is trickling through to the displaced, according to Mr Abu Jarad – “a portion of rice to share between seven” members of his family.“So I take a small spoon of rice and I tell them I’m full, so they can eat,” he says.Water flows from a tap where long crowds of displaced people queue. “People push and I don’t have the strength to resist,” he says.His daughter, Rim, had to give up the painkillers she has taken since birth because of her spinal and shoulder malformations.“The pain prevents me from sleeping but we can’t buy medicines,” she says.She too forgoes meals because her brothers and sisters “have more need to eat”.

       "  'Text': 'GAZA  -     As an unrelenting Israeli bombardment intensified on Saturday, bakeries in Gaza were running out of bread, drinking water was in short supply and power outages left families without charged phones to find out if fleeing relatives were safe.\"There is an electricity crisis, food crisis, water crisis, a crisis of everything,\" Eyad Abu Mutlaq, 45, said in Khan Younis in south Gaza, a region filling up with thousands of people fleeing the north for fear of an Israeli invasion.\"It is only God who can resolve it,\" he said after touring four bakeries to find long queues or no supplies.The flood of people arriving in south Gaza after Israel told them on Friday to leave an area in the north has stretched resources that were already strained to breaking point.The United Nations has urged Israel to \"avert a humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza, a slither of land with 2.3 million people wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.In its response to the devastating Oct. 7 assault from Gaza by Palestinian militant group Hamas, Israel has imposed a \"total blockade\" halting food supplies and cutting electricity to Gaza. A week after that began, shops are running out of many items.\"I was looking for basic food, eggs, rice, canned food, even milk for the children and I couldn’t find them,\" said Khan Younis resident, giving only her nickname of Um Salem. \"This is how Israel is fighting us, through starvation of our children. They either kill children by bombs or soon by starvation.\"Israel said it had told people to leave the north for their safety and to ensure they were not caught up in the conflict. It said it would guarantee the safety of Palestinians fleeing the area on two main roads until 4 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Friday.Those who have fled say many roads and streets are often difficult to use, and some impassable, because of damage.APPEAL TO END THE \\'SIEGE\\'Gaza authorities said 70 people were killed and 200 were wounded when Israel struck cars and trucks carrying people fleeing the north. Reuters could not independently verify this.The Hamas assault last week killed more than 1,300 Israelis. The fighters also took scores of hostages in the worst breach of Israel\\'s defences since its creation in 1948.The death toll from Israel\\'s response was more than 2,200 people by Saturday.Without the option of crossing the border into Egypt, more of Gaza\\'s population has been cramming into the south seeking shelter, as Israel builds up troops and tanks on border. Israel has already launched raids.\"We need to truck fuel into Gaza now. Fuel is the only way for people to have safe drinking water. If not, people will start dying of severe dehydration, among them young children, the elderly and women,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the U.N. refugee agency UNRWA,.\"Water is now the last remaining lifeline. I appeal for the siege on humanitarian assistance to be lifted now,\" he said.U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday he was making it a priority to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, working with Israel, Egypt, Jordan, other Arab states and the U.N. He said he was also ensuring Israel had what it needed to respond to the Oct. 7 attack, including bringing any U.S. hostages home.The Gaza authorities have reported 10,000 people injured so far in the bombardment. Hospitals are struggling to cope. Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra said hospitals were running low of medical supplies and fuel to keep going.More than 1,695 buildings and high-rise towers have been destroyed in the Israeli airstrikes, in addition to 7,000 housing units, the Hamas government media office said.With power cuts and no fuel to operate generators, Adel Shaheen has been charging people\\'s phones with his solar panels during daylight hours.\"We don\\'t see the electricity anymore and if we want to charge a mobile we have to wait for the sun, otherwise we have no electricity at all,” he said. \"People want to charge (mobile phones) so they can make calls to check on their families.\"But he said most Gazans were now \"cut off from the world\".

       "  'Text': 'A breakdown in civil order has put four U.N. aid distribution centres and a storage facility out of action in Gaza as people  search desperately for food and water, a U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) official said on Monday.Tom White, director of UNWRA Affairs in Gaza, also said that a logistics base at the Rafah border crossing vital to aid distribution had become increasingly difficult to operate because 8,000 people were sheltering at it.\"With the breakdown of civil order, every day now we\\'ve got hundreds of people trying to get into the warehouses to steal flour,\" he told Reuters.\"Right now people are in survival mode. It\\'s about getting enough flour and it\\'s about getting enough water.\"Thousands of Gaza residents broke into U.N. warehouses on Sunday to seize flour and other items. One of the warehouses, in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, is where UNRWA stores supplies delivered by humanitarian convoys crossing into Gaza from Egypt.\"Effectively, we have lost Deir al-Balah. We\\'ll see whether we can get that up and operational again,\\xa0but of course\\xa0it\\'s complicated because right now the Rafah log (logistics) base has become a magnet for people who are either seeking shelter, seeking protection under the UN flag, or are trying to get into the warehouses to get flour,\" White said.Aid to Gaza has been choked since Israel began bombarding the Palestinian enclave in response to an attack by the Hamas militant group on Oct. 7 that killed 1,400 people.There has been a mounting international outcry over the toll from the bombing. Medical authorities in Hamas-run Gaza, which has a population of 2.3 million people, said on Monday that 8,306 people - including 3,457 minors - had been killed.The Palestinian Red Crescent said so far 140 trucks of aid had entered Gaza since Oct. 7 and the biggest delivery so far of 33 trucks arrived on Sunday.But U.N. officials say at least 100 trucks a day are required to cover Gaza\\'s urgent needs. Before the war several hundred trucks were normally arriving in Gaza daily.Aid entering from Egypt is being driven on a round-trip of more than 84 km (52 miles) from Rafah for inspection on the Egypt-Israel border, triggering Egyptian complaints.Israel says it does not want aid to enter from its territory or to fall into the hands of Hamas, refusing delivery of fuel, water supplies and relief distribution in Gaza.  On Sunday U.S. President Joe Biden and Egypt\\'s Abdel Fattah al-Sisi committed to a significant acceleration of assistance. Several dozen trucks set off from the Egyptian side of Rafah on Monday, humanitarian and security sources said.   COLLAPSE OF SERVICESBut White said that due to delays, the situation was so bad that more aid was no longer a solution to Gaza\\'s plight. A humanitarian ceasefire was needed, he said.\"With a collapse of public services, that\\'s not going to be something that\\'s going to be solved by food, water or medicine. If the public sector collapses here, you\\'re into a different magnitude of need,\" he saidUNRWA was unable to distribute flour to bakers on Sunday and was down to distributing one litre of potable water per person to displaced people, he said, adding that in a humanitarian response a survival rate was three litres per day. White said Gaza\\'s south had been overwhelmed by an influx of displaced people from the north.Access on roads was reasonable in the south but increasingly difficult in the north due to damage and security as Israeli forces attacked Gaza\\'s main northern city.Tommaso Della Longa, spokesperson of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said Gaza was in desperate condition.\"The longer it continues the more we will see desperation,\" he said. \"If you are not able to get supplies to people who are starving, people will find a way.\" REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON - Israel\\'s war Cabinet has agreed to allow 140,000 litres of fuel into Gaza every two days, after a request from Washington, amid acute shortages that threatened aid deliveries and communications in the besieged strip, Israel and US officials said on Friday.Israel imposed a strict blockade on all goods entering Hamas-controlled Gaza when it launched a military campaign in response to the Palestinian militant group\\'s Oct 7 rampage, in which they killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages.Israel has since agreed to allow in aid trucks after stringent inspections, and a small amount of fuel was allowed in on Wednesday to keep United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) aid delivery trucks moving.An Israeli official who declined to be identified said two trucks a day would be allowed in to meet the UN\\'s needs, but said the amount would give \"minimal\" support for water, sewage and sanitary systems in Gaza to prevent pandemics.A US State Department official, offering more details, said Israel had committed to allowing in 120,000 litres of fuel every 48 hours for UNRWA\\'s trucks and other needs like desalinisation of water, sewage pumping, bakeries and hospitals in the south of Gaza.An additional 20,000 litres every two days would be allowed in to power generators of telecoms company Paltel, which had warned of an imminent blackout of its cellphone network due to lack of fuel. US officials have been pushing Israel to allow fuel in for some time. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken made calls to members of Israel\\'s war Cabinet on Wednesday, and warned that the fuel shortage risked a humanitarian catastrophe among Gaza\\'s 2.3 million residents, the State Department official said. Israeli officials had previously argued that Hamas should release hostages before it eased the pressure on Gaza, the official said, adding that negotiations on the release of hostages continue separate from the move on fuel.    The Israeli official confirmed the decision came after a request from Washington, and said allowing the fuel in gives Israel extra room to maneuver in the international arena so it can continue its campaign to eradicate Hamas in Gaza.

       "  'Title': 'Israel PM Netanyahu rejects Gaza ceasefire, says it amounts to ‘surrendering to Hamas’',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday a ceasefire in the Israel’s war against Hamas “will not happen”, as the United Nations warned not enough aid was coming in to meet “unprecedented humanitarian needs”.Israeli ground forces fought inside the Gaza Strip and air strikes pounded the besieged Hamas-run Palestinian territory in response to the Oct 7 attack – the deadliest in Israel’s history.The intensifying military operations have sharply heightened fears for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza, where the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says more than 8,300 have been killed.In a briefing to foreign press, Mr Netanyahu said a ceasefire would amount to surrendering to Hamas, whose gunmen killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages, according to the latest Israeli figures.“Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen,” he said, vowing Israel will “fight until this battle is won”.The United States, Israel’s ally, also objected to a ceasefire.“We do not believe that a ceasefire is the right answer right now,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, adding that “pauses” to get aid into Gaza should be considered instead.As Israeli forces battled Hamas militants inside the narrow Palestinian territory and sent tanks to the outskirts of Gaza City, concern has surged about the widening humanitarian crisis.Mr Kirby said Washington was “confident” of increasing the number of aid trucks to Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt to around 100 a day.Limited aid has entered Gaza from Egypt under a US-brokered deal, but its volume has fallen far short of the hundreds of trucks a day aid agencies say are needed.Mr Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, called for the Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs,” he said.Israeli tanks on Gaza highway The Hamas attack set off the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, marked by weeks of withering aerial bombardment and three continuous nights of ground operations centred on northern Gaza, which Israel has told civilians to evacuate.Columns of Israeli tanks and armoured bulldozers were seen churning through the sand, and snipers took positions inside emptied residential buildings, in footage released by the army.Dozens of tanks advanced for more than an hour into the southern fringes of Gaza City and blocked the main north-south highway, “firing at any vehicle that tries to go on it”, an eyewitness told AFP by phone.Air strikes also cratered the road and brought down buildings, residents said, before the tanks withdrew.The Israeli ground forces were supported by heavy fire from the air and artillery, with the army striking more than 600 targets within 24 hours, up from 450 reported by the military a day earlier.Hamas said it had fired anti-tank missiles at two Israeli armoured vehicles and that “blows delivered by the resistance have prevented” Israeli troops from establishing a presence in Gaza.The Israeli military also said a woman soldier was rescued from captivity after an operation in the Hamas-run territory. The release of Ms Ori Megidish was “secured during a ground operation”, the army said, adding that she had been “medically checked” and was “doing well”.Mr Netanyahu said the international community must demand the captives remaining in Gaza “be freed immediately, unconditionally”.Hamas released a video of what it said were three women hostages, seated against a tile wall, although the time and place of the recording could not be verified.One called in an agitated tone for Mr Netanyahu to agree to Hamas’ proposed exchange of the hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Mr Netanyahu decried the clip as “cruel psychological propaganda”.‘Bombing followed us’ The more than 230 hostages – aged between a few months and above 80 – are believed to be held in a network of underground tunnels where Hamas has hid its military infrastructure from Israeli surveillance and air attacks.Israel confirmed the death of one of those missing – German-Israeli Shani Louk, 23, who was captured by Hamas when its gunmen stormed a desert music festival.Fear and desperation have spiralled in Gaza, under weeks of siege that have cut off water, food, fuel and other essentials.Internet access was severed on Friday but restored on Sunday following US pressure, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.“We made clear to the government of Israel over the weekend that communications networks needed to be restored,” he said on Monday. “It is about ensuring that vital information flows, humanitarian coordination continues and families can stay in touch.”The UN reported on Sunday that “thousands of people” had ransacked aid warehouses in Gaza.Donkey carts were lining up to load water, as safe drinking water has become scarce in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.According to the UN, all 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders – despite sheltering thousands of patients and about 117,000 displaced people.“We were displaced from our homes to the hospital,” Gaza City resident Ashraf al-Muzani, 38, said from Al-Quds hospital where he and his family have sheltered for a week. “The bombing followed us,” he added. “We haven’t been able to sleep and our children are so frightened.”‘Highest’ UN death toll Mr Lazzarini said 64 of his colleagues had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, “the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict in such a short time”.Anti-Israel anger has flared across the region and beyond.In Russia’s Muslim-majority Dagestan, police said they had arrested 60 people after a crowd stormed an airport on Sunday to attack passengers arriving from Tel Aviv.And Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the US of being responsible for what he called “deadly chaos” unfolding in the Middle East.Washington has warned Israel’s enemies – in particular Iran-allied groups – not to become more fully involved after a series of attacks across the region. Israel’s military has struck targets in Syria and traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told AFP he was “doing my duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war”.Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank where health officials say about 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire and in settler attacks since the Gaza war started.

       "  'Title': 'Buckling Gaza health service turns to volunteers',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA - Gaza medical chiefs are turning to volunteers to help run an emergency service buckling under Israel\\'s offensive.Ambulances are struggling to reach bomb sites past rubble-strewn roads and with ever-depleting supplies of fuel.Medical and emergency staff have worked with little rest and are deploying in the most dangerous areas, witnessing the horror of violent death, terrible injuries and grief. Gaza\\'s health ministry has called on all trained paramedics to help staff hospitals and call-out teams.But although dozens have responded the system is still in dire need of more workers, it said. \"I have not gone home since the first day of the war. I shower here, sleep here and eat here,\" said Mr Loay al-Astal, a volunteer emergency worker in Khan Younis, in the south of the enclave. Health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave say Israeli air and artillery strikes have killed more than 8,000 people since Oct 7.That is when Hamas fighters rampaged through security barriers to kill more than 1,400 Israelis and take more than 200 hostage. After Israel began ground operations on Friday, many Gaza residents fear the destruction will intensify. Israel has ordered civilians to leave the northern half of the Gaza Strip for the south.But it has continued an intense bombardment across the enclave and many people are refusing to leave. Shelling on Gaza\\'s main north-south road on Monday meant the enclave was all but cut in two, with any attempts to flee south risking bombardment. The health ministry said 116 medical staff had been killed in the bombardment since Oct 7, along with 18 civil emergency department rescuers. Mr Astal, the volunteer who had trained at university to be a paramedic but was unemployed when the war began, described an incident in which some of his colleagues had nearly been killed  by an air strike that blew out the windows of their ambulance. \"The glass was smashed and some of our volunteers were wounded,\" he said. He is haunted by the memory of trying to save a woman who was buried up to her neck in rubble from an air strike. \"There was a cut on her head and I rushed to treat the wound,\" Mr Astal, 33, said.She asked him to free her from the rubble so she could find her son, but she died minutes later, still trapped, he said. \"I felt bad I couldn\\'t save her,\" he said. ‘Where should we go?’ The head of the Khan Younis ambulance service, Mr Naseem Hassan, said the department was overwhelmed and needed trained medics. \"We opened the door for volunteers and many young people answered that call and have been on duty since the war began,\" he said.Along with the bombardment, Israel has imposed a total blockade on the enclave, home to 2.3 million people, cutting supplies of electricity and fuel. Limited food and medical aid deliveries have entered Gaza since last week after international pressure on Israel. \"Ambulances are about to go out of operation because we have very limited fuel left. We have problems with communications. We lose touch with the ambulances that leave here,\" said volunteer driver Mr Sari al-Najjar. Phone and internet services in Gaza were cut off for nearly two days over the weekend as Israeli tanks started moving into the enclave. Communications gradually started returning from Sunday. Without reliable power supplies, many residents were unable to charge phones, adding to the difficulties for ambulance crews trying to locate and coordinate rescues. Thousands of people have gathered at hospitals in Gaza City, in the north of the enclave, many sheltering in makeshift tents hoping for some safety from the bombardment.  Medical officials said air strikes in the vicinity of the major Gaza City hospitals including al-Shifa, al-Quds and the Turkish Friendship hospital, have caused damage.Israel has accused Hamas of placing command centres and weaponry near hospitals, which the group denies.\"Where should we go? It is all one death,\" said Mr Hatem Sultan, sheltering near al-Shifa Hospital, the enclave\\'s biggest medical centre, where ambulances were constantly arriving with people injured in air strikes.

       "  'Text': 'ANKARA  -     Turkey is ready to take in cancer patients from Gaza\\'s Turkish-Palestinian Friendship hospital, which went out of service on Wednesday after running out of fuel, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said on Thursday.Health officials said on Wednesday that the hospital, which was the only cancer treatment hospital in the Gaza Strip, had to shut down amid Israel\\'s bombardment of the enclave.In a statement on social messaging platform X, Koca said that if the necessary coordination was done Turkey was ready to bring both cancer patients and others in need of emergency help to Turkey to continue their treatment.\"As Turkey... we are ready to provide any and all support in continuing the treatment of cancer patients who were forcibly discharged from the hospital due to a lack of resources,\" Koca said.\"The international community and relevant institutions have unfortunately not taken enough initiative to prevent the attacks on the hospital. Saving the lives of the patients is now a duty that cannot be escaped,\" he added.Earlier the United Arab Emirates said it planned to treat 1,000 Palestinian children from Gaza, without saying how they would leave the enclave for the Gulf state.Turkey has so far sent more than 200 tonnes of humanitarian aid and a team of medical personnel to Egypt for Gazans, while also offering to set up a field hospital near the Rafah border crossing. It has strongly condemned Israeli attacks on Gaza, carried out in retaliation for Palestinian militant group Hamas\\' Oct. 7 assault on Israel, and has called for a ceasefire.In an update by Medical Aid for Palestinians, Dr. Marwan Abusada, chief of surgery at Gaza\\'s Al-Shifa Hospital, said the situation was \"beyond catastrophic\" at hospitals in Gaza.\"We are almost out of fuel... The consumption needs are immense due to the influx of injuries and the thousands of people who are displaced and seeking refuge in the hospital,\" Abusada said, adding Al-Shifa had more than 800 injured people, far beyond its capacity.He said many displaced people were living in the hospital courtyard and inside the building, including its corridors, and that there was a high chance of pandemics spreading between the patients and displaced.\"The ER rooms are beyond full. We have zero capacity to treat all the injured people. Every hour we have tens of injured that come for treatment. We are facing a real catastrophe.\" REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'GAZA/WASHINGTON - Israel’s military intensified its assault on Hamas militants in Gaza, as the United States and other global powers called for aid to continue flowing into the besieged strip to prevent an already grave humanitarian crisis from worsening.Israel’s military said it had hit more than 400 militant targets in Gaza overnight and killed dozens of Hamas fighters, including three deputy battalion commanders.In a statement, the military said that among the targets hit was a tunnel which allowed Hamas to infiltrate Israel from the sea and Hamas command centres in mosques. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.Earlier, Israeli Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi suggested Israel has no intention of curbing its strikes on the densely populated Gaza Strip.He also hinted the country is well-prepared for a ground assault.“We want to bring Hamas to a state of full dismantling,” Mr Haveli said. “The path is a path of unrelenting attacks, damaging Hamas everywhere and in every way.“We are well-prepared for the ground operations in the south,” he added, referring to southern Israel which abuts Gaza. “There are tactical, operative, strategic considerations that have provided additional time, and troops who have more time are better prepared, and that is what we are doing now.”The Palestinian health ministry said the Gaza death toll in two weeks of air strikes has surpassed 5,000.The Israeli bombardment was triggered by a Hamas assault on Oct 7 that killed more than 1,400 people. Gunmen from the militant group also took some 200 people hostage.Hamas on Monday freed two Israeli women. US President Joe Biden welcomed the release of the hostages.He also underscored the need to sustain “a continuous flow” of humanitarian assistance into Gaza in a telephone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said.On its part, China called for a “more authoritative, wide-ranging and effective international peace conference” soon, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki in a telephone call.A Cairo peace summit on Saturday saw Arab leaders condemn Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, but fail to agree on a joint statement. Absent were Israel and the US.In public, the United States has stressed Israel’s right to defend itself.But two sources familiar with the matter said the White House, Pentagon and State Department have stepped up private appeals for caution in conversations with the Israelis.A US priority is to gain time for negotiations to free other hostages.Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, US President Joe Biden said: ““We should have those hostages released and then we can talk.”At least 10 British nationals have been killed in the conflict between Israel and Hamas and a further six remain missing, junior British finance minister Victoria Atkins told Times Radio on Tuesday.Obama warns Israel against civilian casualtiesIn a rare comment by a former US president, Mr Barack Obama has warned that “any Israeli military strategy that ignores the human costs could ultimately backfire”.He issued a written statement warning Israel not to cause so many civilian casualties in retaliating against Hamas that it would alienate generations of Palestinians.“Any Israeli military strategy that ignores the human costs could ultimately backfire. Already, thousands of Palestinians have been killed in the bombing of Gaza, many of them children. Hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes,” Mr Obama said the a statement posted on social media.It is not immediately clear whether Mr Obama coordinated his statement with Mr Biden, who was his vice-president. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“The Israeli government’s decision to cut off food, water and electricity to a captive civilian population threatens not only to worsen a growing humanitarian crisis,” he added.“It could further harden Palestinian attitudes for generations, erode global support for Israel, play into the hands of Israel’s enemies, and undermine long term efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region,” he wrote in the statement published in Medium that also condemned Hamas’s attack and reiterated his support for Israel’s right to defend itself.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken planned on Tuesday to attend a UN Security Council meeting on the Middle East.It is unclear what action, if any, might be taken by the council, whose five veto-wielding powers appear divided.Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has allowed China and Russia to burnish their credentials as the champions of the developing world, in contrast with the US, which has squarely supported Israel. All three big powers hold Council vetoes.Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Tel Aviv on Tuesday to express his country’s “full solidarity” with Israel. He is also expected to call for the “preservation of the civilian population” in Gaza.With Gaza’s 2.3 million people running short of basics, European leaders looked set to follow the United Nations and Arab nations in calling for a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities so aid could reach them.A convoy of humanitarian aid trucks delivered water, food and medicine to the Gaza Strip on Monday, the third since aid began flowing on Saturday.But the United Nations said fuel was not included and reserves will run out within two days.The UN said desperate Gazans also lacked places to shelter from the unrelenting pounding that has flattened swathes of the Hamas-ruled enclave.The conflict meanwhile is escalating beyond Gaza.Israeli aircraft hit positions in south Lebanon held by Hezbollah which, like Hamas, is a group allied to Israel’s long-time foe Iran. The Israeli army and Palestinians also clashed in the occupied West Bank and Hamas fired more rockets into Israel.Hostages freedThe two women Hamas released on Monday were the third and fourth hostages to be freed. “We decided to release them for humanitarian and poor health grounds,” Mr Abu Ubaida, spokesman for the armed wing of the Palestinian Hamas militant group, said on Telegram.The Israeli prime minister’s office issued a statement confirming that the women, whom it named as Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, were handed over to the Israeli military and would be taken to a medical facility.The two were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, near Gaza, along with their husbands, who are still held by Hamas, it added. Hamas freed the two elderly women after releasing an American woman and her daughter on Friday.Fighting inside GazaIsrael said its armed forces’ incursions overnight were partly intended to gather intelligence, with the whereabouts of the hostages unknown, and had helped improve its military readiness.“These raids are raids that kill squads of terrorists who are preparing for our next stage in the war. These are raids that go deep,” military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said.Hamas’s armed wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters engaged with an Israeli force that infiltrated southern Gaza, destroying two bulldozers and a tank and forcing the raiders to withdraw.Israel made no comment on the incident.The Al-Qassam Brigades also said they were firing missiles at the southern Israeli towns of Ashkelon and Mavki’im. Warning sirens sounded on the Israeli side.The Israeli military, the Middle East’s most powerful, faces a group that has built up a large arsenal with Iran’s help, fighting in a crowded urban setting and using a vast tunnel network.The UN humanitarian office (OCHA) said about 1.4 million of Gaza’s population - more than half - are now internally displaced.Many are seeking refuge in overcrowded UN emergency shelters.Israel has ordered Gaza residents to evacuate the north. But many who had fled appeared to be returning north due to increased bombardments in the south and lack of shelter.“They told us to evacuate your place and go to Khan Younis because it is safe... They betrayed us and bombed us,” said 18-year-old Dima Al-Lamdani who lost her parents, seven siblings and four members of her uncle’s family in an air strike after the family moved south.Spreading violence Early on Monday, Israeli warplanes also struck two Hezbollah cells in Lebanon that were planning to launch missiles and rockets towards Israel, the Israeli military said. Israel also hit a Hezbollah compound and an observation post.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, two Palestinians were killed at the Jalazone refugee camp near Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority health ministry said.Residents told Reuters that Israeli forces raided the camp and made many arrests as they clashed with gunmen and some youths who threw stones. The Israeli military said 15 suspects were captured, 10 of them Hamas operatives. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'GENEVA – \\xa0The United Nations’ high commissioner for human rights on Tuesday condemned allegations of mass killings and executions by Palestinian armed groups, as he warned that Israel’s announcement of a “complete siege” of Gaza would exacerbate the “already dire” humanitarian situation in the coast.“All parties must respect international humanitarian law,” Mr Volker Turk said in a statement. “They must immediately cease attacks targeting civilians and attacks expected to cause disproportionate death and injury of civilians or damage to civilian objects.”As Israeli warplanes struck hundreds of sites on Monday, Israel’s defence minister said “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed into Gaza, which is controlled by the militant group Hamas and is under a 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt that heavily restricts access for people and goods. Mr Turk said the ability of medical facilities to treat the growing number of people wounded in Israeli strikes would be harmed by a “full siege”.  “The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,” he said. He added that restrictions on people and goods must be “justified by military necessity” or may amount to collective punishment.The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza warned on Sunday of large shortages of medicine and health equipment, as well as fuel required to keep hospital electrical generators running.Mr Turk also said he was “deeply shocked and appalled by allegations of summary executions of civilians, and, in some instances, horrifying mass killings by members of Palestinian armed groups”. He called on Palestinian armed factions to immediately release Israeli civilians who were taken hostage. About 150 people are believed to have been abducted by Palestinian gunmen in the attacks that began on Saturday.“It is horrific and deeply distressing to see images of those captured by Palestinian armed groups being ill-treated, as well as reports of killings and the desecration of their bodies,” he said. “Civilians must never be used as bargaining chips.”The World Health Organisation (WHO) called on Tuesday for a humanitarian corridor to be established into and out of the Gaza.The WHO had reported 13 attacks on health facilities in Gaza since the weekend, and that the organisation’s medical supplies stored there had already been used up.\\xa0“WHO is calling for an end to the violence… A humanitarian corridor is needed to reach people with critical medical supplies,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told journalists in Geneva.“We need supplies to come in: hospitals cannot run without fuel, without electricity.“The supplies that we have pre-positioned are already running low so we need those supplies to come,” Mr Jasarevic said.The United Nations humanitarian office said nearly 200,000 people, or nearly a tenth of the population, have fled their homes in Gaza since the start of hostilities.

       "  'Title': 'Israel-Hamas war and the dangers of a creeping occupation',\n",
       "  'Text': 'US President Joe Biden has warned Israel that occupying Gaza “would be a big mistake”. The warning seemed to be aimed directly at voices within the Israeli government who are calling for Israel to not only destroy Hamas, but also to occupy the Palestinian territory.Mr Biden\\xa0supports Israel’s right to defend itself\\xa0and to destroy Hamas’ military capabilities. But, if history is anything to go by, then occupation – as a strategy to destroy Hamas – seems doomed to fail. The Gaza Strip\\xa0was under Israeli military occupation following the June 1967 war (it was earlier occupied by Egypt) until Israel unilaterally withdrew from the territory\\xa0in 2005. This included the removal of 21 settlements comprising 8,500 Israeli civilians who were living amid 1.4 million Palestinians. The realities of occupationThe occupation of Gaza required the diversion of significant military and economic resources to protect the settlers in a land with which most Israelis did not feel a sense of kinship. Polls\\xa0from 2004\\xa0and\\xa02005\\xa0of Israeli public opinion showed that between 53 per cent and 60 per cent supported the disengagement plan.Indeed, the recent Hamas attacks are a painful reminder of the occupation’s costs. In response to rising tensions in recent weeks in the West Bank and East Jerusalem (both occupied by Israel since 1967 and previously under Jordanian occupation), the Israeli army diverted its entire Gaza division to protect Israeli settlers in the West Bank and to prevent a deadly escalation there over the Jewish holidays. This left the Israeli military significantly under-equipped and under-manned to respond immediately and decisively to the Hamas attacks from Gaza.Already burdened by policing missions around Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and with the ever-present threat of a military confrontation with Hezbollah (the Iranian-backed Shi’ite militia group established in the early 1980s) along its northern border, the notion of a military reoccupation of Gaza by Israel would probably see its resources stretched not only beyond capacity, but also beyond its long-term interests.The Israeli government’s stated aims for its current operation have so far been vague. “Destroying Hamas’ military capabilities” may mean different things to different people – from the precise targeting of its arms and the killing of its military leaders, to destroying Hamas as an idea.What occupation cannot solveMilitary occupation is unlikely to kill the violent Hamas ideology. Indeed, it was the first Palestinian popular uprising (intifada) against the Israeli occupation in the West Bank which gave rise to\\xa0Hamas in 1987, as a younger, Islamist alternative to the Fatah leadership. Fatah, the dominant faction of the Palestinian Authority (PA) which administers the Palestinian areas in the West Bank, is a secular, nationalist party that recognises Israel – whereas Hamas does not.So any sustained military occupation of Gaza is likely to garner more support for Hamas, rather than eradicate it. It is also unlikely that the PA in the West Bank would be eager to fill the power vacuum which would be created in the unlikely event that Israel successfully eradicates Hamas altogether, for fear of being depicted as Israeli collaborators by the Palestinian people. Moreover, an occupation brings with it the responsibility of administering the daily lives of 2.3 million Palestinians. This is something that neither Israel nor the PA wants or can do in the current circumstances.Lessons from 1982Israeli leaders should also take lessons from the last time the country tried to eradicate a terrorist group and impose regime change.In 1982, the Israeli military invaded southern Lebanon to remove the threat of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) to its northern towns. It ended with a failed alliance with the Christian Phalange party in Lebanon, which directly led to the\\xa0Sabra and Shatila massacre\\xa0and an 18-year Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, ending with a\\xa0“chaotic” withdrawal in 2000. None of Israel’s options to achieve its aim of destroying Hamas’ military capabilities is easy. Relying solely on air strikes will lead to a large number of civilian casualties, and is unlikely to destroy\\xa0Hamas’ tunnels\\xa0or kill its military leaders.A ground operation will not only lead to a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented proportions, but is also likely to start a creeping, short-term occupation leading to a permanent occupation – as the history of the June 1967 and 1982 Lebanon wars shows.Since its military and civilian withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, and following Hamas’ takeover of the territory from Fatah in 2007, Israel has blockaded the strip for security reasons by air, land and sea, effectively controlling who and what is allowed to enter and leave. Egypt has similarly blockaded the southern border of the Gaza Strip by Rafah.While Israel no longer occupies Gaza – inasmuch as it is not responsible for the daily lives of Gazans – the continuous blockade has significantly contributed to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the strip. That Hamas has proven to be a more capable terrorist organisation than an effective government has only set the Palestinian quest for freedom and statehood back even further.Asaf Siniver is professor of international security, University of Birmingham.

       "  'Text': 'DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip  -     Children played on a Gaza beach as displaced families left their cramped shelters for a short break during the truce between Israel and Hamas, but amid the laughter their parents could not forget the hardships of war and homelessness.As children splashed in the shallow water, jumping over small waves, adults in bare feet watched from the shore. Asmaa al-Sultan, a displaced woman from northern Gaza, sat on the sand with her arm around her mother. The older woman was crying quietly.More than 30 members of the al-Sultan family are sheltering in a U.N. school in the town of Deir Al-Balah with hundreds of other displaced people.\"We came to the beach to take a breather, to escape from the feeling of the crowded schools and from the depressing and polluted environment we are in,\" said Asmaa.\"People come to the beach to relax, to swim, for their children to have fun, they take food with them. But we are so depressed. We are on the beach but we want to cry.\"Hundreds of thousands of people have left their homes in northern Gaza, which has borne the brunt of Israel\\'s military assault, to seek refuge in tents, schools or the homes of friends and relatives in the southern part of the strip.The gruelling conditions in the tent camps and schools, with overcrowding, a dearth of toilets and showers, and long daily queues for small rations of food and water, have been compounded by the psychological impact of bombardment and displacement.The beach at Deir Al-Balah has a row of fishermen\\'s huts at the back, towards the bottom of a slope strewn with rubbish. Some displaced people had taken up residence in the flimsy huts, clothes hanging on strings outside.\\'WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO US NEXT?\\'Waleed al-Sultan, one of Asmaa\\'s younger relatives, was trying to untangle a net near the huts as he prepared to go out fishing in a small boat, hoping the truce would mean he could do so without danger.\"I brought nothing with me when I was displaced, so I thought I would make a living from fishing, but the (Israeli) guards stopped me and started shooting at us,\" he said.The war began when Hamas militants burst out of Gaza on Oct. 7 and rampaged through southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, including babies and children, and seizing 240 hostages.Israel responded with an all-out assault on Gaza which has killed 14,800 Palestinians, four in ten of them children under 18, according to health officials in the Hamas-controlled territory.While some displaced people have seized the opportunity of the four-day truce, which began on Friday, to check on their homes, others have been too fearful to return to the north, much of which has been reduced to a wasteland.\"We are afraid about the end of these four days. We don\\'t know what will happen to us next,\" said Hazem al-Sultan, Asmaa\\'s husband.He said they and their relatives had not dared to head north for fear of being shot at by Israeli soldiers, and had no idea what state their homes might be in.\"We are afraid for our children, for ourselves, and we don\\'t know what to do,\" he said.

       "  'Title': 'Aid supplies to Gaza halted again, UN says starvation imminent   ',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM – United Nations aid deliveries to Gaza were suspended again on Nov 17 due to shortages of fuel and a communications shutdown, deepening the misery of thousands of hungry and homeless Palestinians as Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the enclave. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said civilians faced the “immediate possibility of starvation” due to the lack of food supplies. Palestinian news agency Wafa said a number of Palestinians were killed and others injured in an Israeli strike that hit a group of displaced people near the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt – the transit point for aid. Al Jazeera TV cited sources as saying that nine people were killed in the strike. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the reported strike, and Reuters could not verify it.In other developments, Israel said its troops had found a tunnel shaft used by Hamas at Al-Shifa Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip.The hospital, packed with patients and displaced people and struggling to keep operating, has been a major focus of global concern this week. Israel says Hamas has stored weapons and ammunition and is holding hostages in a network of tunnels under hospitals like Shifa, using patients and people taking shelter there as human shields. Hamas denies this.With the war about to enter its seventh week, there is no sign of any let-up despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.The conflict was triggered by a cross-border raid by Hamas militants on Oct 7 that killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, in the deadliest day in the state’s 75-year-history.More than 11,500 Palestinians, at least 4,700 of them children, have now been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military assault on Hamas-ruled Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry – a toll that far surpasses previous bouts of conflict in recent years.Israel has vowed to wipe out the militant group. Whole neighbourhoods of Gaza have been flattened in air and artillery strikes, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, and the humanitarian situation is catastrophic, aid agencies say.Trucks suspendedThe UN said there would be no cross-border aid operation on Nov 17 due to fuel shortages and a communication shutdown.  For a second consecutive day on Nov 16, no aid lorries arrived in Gaza due to lack of fuel for distributing relief.WFP executive director Cindy McCain said nearly the entire population was in desperate need of food assistance.“Supplies of food and water are practically non-existent in Gaza and only a fraction of what is needed is arriving through the borders,” she said in a statement.“With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,” Ms McCain said.A UN human rights official said Israel must allow water and fuel into Gaza to restart the water supply network.“Every hour that passes with Israel preventing the provision of safe drinking water in the Gaza Strip, in brazen breach of international law, puts Gazans at risk of dying of thirst and diseases,” Mr Pedro Arrojo-Agudo said.The World Health Organisation on Nov 17 said it was very worried about the spread of disease in Gaza, citing more than 70,000 reported cases of acute respiratory infections and over 44,000 cases of diarrhoea, far more than expected.The Israeli military’s chief of staff said Israel was close to destroying Hamas’ military system in the northern Gaza Strip, and there were signs the army was taking its campaign to other parts of the coastal enclave of 2.3 million people.Israel accused Hamas of preventing people from heading to the south of the Gaza Strip, which the militant group denied.The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of Al-Shifa, Gaza’s biggest hospital.The video, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a deep hole in the ground, littered with and surrounded by concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.The army said its troops also found a vehicle in the hospital containing a large number of weapons.Reuters journalists have been unable to reach anyone inside Al-Shifa Hospital for more than 24 hours.Hamas on Nov 16 said claims by the United States that the group uses Shifa for military purposes were “a repetition of a blatantly false narrative, demonstrated by the weak and ridiculous performances of the occupation army spokesman”. Israeli officials said Hamas held some of the 240 hostages taken by gunmen on Oct 7 in the hospital complex.On Nov 17 the Israeli military said soldiers retrieved the body of a female soldier who had been held captive in a building near Shifa.The military confirmed her death on Nov 14 after Hamas issued a video of her alive, followed by images of what it said was her body after she was killed in an Israeli strike.On Nov 16, troops recovered the body of another woman hostage, also in a building near Shifa.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Hamas’ Al-Quds Brigades said they had engaged Israeli forces for several hours in the city of Jenin overnight into Nov 17, unleashing a “torrent of fire” and laying ambushes with explosives.Israel’s military said warplanes struck militants in Jenin who had opened fire on Israeli soldiers. It said at least five of the militants were killed.At least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the Oct 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The violence there has underscored fears that the territory, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, could spiral out of control in tandem with the conflict in Gaza. REUTERS',\n",

His last trip to the region that kicked off on Oct 11 was initially announced as a visit to Israel and Jordan but was later expanded to include five more Arab countries, ending up being his most extensive yet trip to the region.

       "  'Text': 'THE HAGUE - Conflict between Israel and Palestinian forces since militant group Hamas\\' weekend assault have created a huge and rising death toll on both sides.The war falls under a complex international system of justice that has emerged since World War Two.What laws govern the conflict?Internationally accepted rules of armed conflict emerged out of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which have been ratified by all UN member states and supplemented by rulings at international war crimes tribunals.A series of treaties governs the treatment of civilians, soldiers and prisoners of war in a system collectively known as the \"Law of Armed Conflict\" or \"International Humanitarian Law\". It applies to government forces and organised armed groups, including Hamas militants.If alleged Palestinian perpetrators of atrocities in Israel and all alleged perpetrators of crimes on the occupied Palestinian territories are not brought to justice at home, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is the only international legal organ able to bring charges. Domestic courts can apply so-called universal jurisdiction in war crimes cases, but that would be limited in scope.The ICC\\'s founding Rome Statute gives it legal authority to investigate alleged crimes on the territory of its members or by their nationals, when domestic authorities are \"unwilling or unable\" to do so.On Tuesday, the office of the prosecutor of the ICC confirmed that its mandate applies to potential crimes committed in the current conflict and said it continues to gather information.What is the role of the ICC?The International Criminal Court (ICC), the world\\'s permanent war crimes tribunals, opened in The Hague in 2002. It has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in its 123 member states or committed by its nationals.Many of the world\\'s major powers are not members, including China, the United States, Russia, India and Egypt. The ICC recognises Palestine as a member state, while Israel rejects the court\\'s jurisdiction and does not formally engage with it. With a limited budget and staff, ICC prosecutors are already investigating 17 cases ranging from Ukraine and Afghanistan to Sudan and Myanmar. The ICC budget has allocated less than 100,000 euros ($106,000) for investigations in the Palestinian territories for 2023 and is seeking additional resources.The ICC has had an ongoing investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the occupied Palestinian territories since 2021. It has not issued any arrest warrants.Prosecutors said in 2021 there was a reasonable basis to believe that violations had been committed on all sides, including by Israeli troops, Hamas militants and other armed Palestinian groups.What acts could violate war crimes law?New York-based Human Rights Watch cited as possible war crimes the deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate rocket attacks, and the taking of civilians as hostages by Palestinian armed groups, as well as the Israeli counter-strikes in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians.\"Deliberate killings of civilians, hostage-taking, and collective punishment are heinous crimes that have no justification,\" said Omar Shakir, the group\\'s Israel and Palestine director.The taking of hostages, murder and torture are explicitly banned under the Geneva Conventions, while Israel\\'s response could also be subject to a war crimes investigation. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant drew criticism from U.N. officials and human rights groups by announcing a tightened blockade to prevent food and fuel from reaching the Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million people.Do the Geneva Conventions apply?Israel has a right and duty to respond, US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday, adding that he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had discussed “how democracies like Israel and the United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law.”A siege can be considered a war crime if it targets civilians, rather than a legitimate means to undermine Hamas\\' military capabilities, or if found to be disproportionate.Attacks on military objectives have to be proportional under international law which means they must not lead to excessive loss of civilian life or damage to civilian objects in relation to the direct and concrete military advantage expected.Mr Nick Kaufman, a British-born Israeli defence lawyer at the ICC, cited the gruesome killings by Hamas militants of hundreds of revellers at a dance rave and civilians in several Kibbutz communities near the Gaza border as an obvious focus for a war crimes case.

       "  'Text': 'GAZA - In the photo, the woman cradles a child in her arms, balanced on her knee. It is an image that resonates, as ancient as human history.But in a grim inversion of the familiar, we see that the child she holds close is a corpse, wrapped in a shroud. It is a quiet moment of intense grief. The woman wears a headscarf and her head is bowed. We cannot see who she is nor can we learn anything about the child - not even if it is a boy or girl.The child is one of many who have lost their lives on both sides in the Israel-Hamas war. Most have names we will never know, whose deaths will spark a lifetime of grief for family members we will never meet. In the 21st century, an average of almost 20 children a day have been killed or maimed in wars around the world, according to UNICEF.Reuters photographer Mohammad Salem was in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on Oct. 17 at the Nasser Hospital morgue, where residents were going to search for missing relatives.He saw the woman squatting on the ground in the morgue, sobbing and tightly embracing the child\\'s body.\"It was a powerful and a sad moment and I felt the picture sums up the broader sense of what was happening in the Gaza Strip,\" he said. \"People were confused, running from one place to another, anxious to know the fate of their loved ones, and this woman caught my eye as she was holding the body of the little girl and refused to let go.\"The moment was particularly poignant for Salem, whose wife gave birth to their own child just days previously.In Gaza, where there have been communications blackouts, tracing people has been fraught with difficulties. But two weeks after the photo was taken, Reuters was able to track down the woman in the photo and interview her at her home in Khan Younis.She is Inas Abu Maamar and the body she was holding in the photo was that of her 5-year-old niece, Saly.Inas had raced to the house of her uncle when she had heard that it had been hit, and then on to the morgue.\"I lost my conscience when I saw the girl, I took her in my arms,\" she said. \"The doctor asked me to let go ... but I told them to leave her with me.\"Saly\\'s mother and sister were also killed, along with Inas\\' uncle and aunt. Saly was a favourite of Inas - she used to drop by her grandmother\\'s house on the way to kindergarten and ask her aunt to take photos of her.\"Most of the videos and pictures in my mobile are of her,\" said Ines.Saly\\'s 4-year-old brother Ahmed was outside the house when it was struck, and survived. He is now living with Inas. But he has little appetite to play, says Inas. He speaks seldom, other than to ask where his sister Saly is. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Blinken says Palestinian voices key to Gaza future',\n",
       "  'Text': 'RAMALLAH/BAGHDAD - Top United States diplomat Antony Blinken said the Palestinian Authority (PA) should play a central role in the future of the Gaza Strip, as he met Iraqi leaders and toured the region amid spiralling tensions over Israel’s war with Hamas.Mr Blinken passed through Israeli checkpoints to meet Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah, then travelled on to Iraq. It was his second visit to the region since the Hamas militants, who rule Gaza, launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 others hostage, according to Israel.Palestinian views, voices and aspirations need to be “at the centre” of conversations about the future of Gaza, Mr Blinken told reporters in Baghdad. As Israel continued a campaign of air strikes that Gaza health officials say has killed 9,770 Palestinians, Secretary of State Blinken rebuffed calls for a ceasefire from Arab officials on Saturday after appealing, unsuccessfully, to Israel for more limited pauses to the fighting a day earlier. “This is a process,” Mr Blinken said about the push for humanitarian pauses, saying Israel has important questions about how they would work, and details are being discussed now. It is important that any pause advance several issues, including hostage release, he said. In discussions with the Iraqi government, Mr Blinken said: “I made very clear that the attacks, the threats coming from militia that are aligned with Iran, are totally unacceptable.” The United States is sending a message to “anyone who might seek to take advantage of the conflict in Gaza to threaten our personnel here or anywhere else in the region: ‘Don’t do it’”, he said.Post-conflict plan  As well as seeking to ensure the conflict does not spread in the region, Mr Blinken is trying to kick-start discussions on how Gaza could be governed, after the complete destruction of Hamas that Israel says is its aim.Mr Abbas told Mr Blinken that Gaza is “an integral part” of the state Palestinians want, according to an account of the meeting from the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, which suggested any PA role in governing Gaza would have to be part of a wider settlement of the decades-old conflict. “We will fully assume our responsibilities within the framework of a comprehensive political solution that includes all of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,” Mr Abbas was quoted by WAFA as saying.The two met for about an hour but did not address the media.“We need to see the US playing the role of an honest mediator, not adopting the Israeli narrative,” head of the Palestinian Mission to the United Kingdom Husam Zomlot told CBS on Sunday.Mr Blinken had some “good ideas” about the future, he said, but “now is the time to... stop the murder of civilians”. Mr Abbas told Mr Blinken there should be an immediate ceasefire and that aid should be allowed into Gaza, according to spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh.Mr Blinken said the United States was committed to getting aid into Gaza and restoring essential services there, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement on the meeting.“The Secretary also expressed the commitment of the United States to working toward the realisation of the Palestinians’ legitimate aspirations for the establishment of a Palestinian state,” Mr Miller said.Troubled authorityMr Blinken has suggested an “effective and revitalized Palestinian Authority” would make the most sense to ultimately run the strip, but admitted that other countries and international agencies would likely play a role in security and governance in the interim.Mr Abbas’ PA, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has seen its popularity shrivel amid allegations of graft, incompetence and widely hated security cooperation arrangements with Israel. It is unclear who will succeed the aging and ailing Mr Abbas, 87, a staunch opponent of Hamas.The foreign ministers of Egypt and Jordan said on Saturday after meeting Mr Blinken that it was premature to talk about the future of Gaza, as they called for an immediate ceasefire to address the humanitarian crisis that has engulfed the strip’s 2.3 million residents.Mr Blinken argued that a ceasefire would only allow Hamas to regroup, but is trying to convince Israel to agree to location-specific pauses that would allow much needed aid to be distributed within Gaza.While Hamas tightly controls besieged Gaza, the West Bank is a complex patchwork of hillside cities, Israeli settlements and army checkpoints that split Palestinian communities.Violence was already at a more than 15-year high in 2023, but has surged further since the war began, with more than 170 attacks on Palestinians involving Jewish settlers recorded by the United Nations.Mr Blinken credited Mr Abbas for tamping down tension in the West Bank and told him he had pressed Israeli officials for accountability, the senior State Department official said.

       "  'Title': 'Maritime corridor, floating hospitals for Gaza in focus at Paris conference',\n",
       "  'Text': 'NICOSIA/PARIS/BRUSSELS  -     World powers meet in Paris on Thursday to coordinate aid and help for the wounded in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, with the possible creation of a maritime corridor, naval medical facilities and field hospitals to be considered, European diplomats said.A month after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas Islamists that killed 1,400 people in Israel, concern is growing over civilian casualties that have soared under Israel\\'s retaliatory bombardments, with more than 10,000 Palestinians killed, and many more wounded and forced to flee their homes.The conference brings together regional stakeholders such as Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf Arab countries as well as Western powers and G20 members - excluding Russia. International institutions and non-governmental organisations operating in Gaza are also due to attend.The Palestinian Authority will be present but Israel has not been invited, although it will be kept informed of the developments.The broad aim is to mobilise financial resources and find ways to get aid into the enclave, while also getting those seriously wounded out given Gaza\\'s medical infrastructure is fast collapsing. Cyprus, the closest EU member state to Gaza, has put forward an idea to get more aid into Gaza via a maritime corridor. It would expand the limited capacities beyond the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza, but the concept is tricky, four diplomats said. Israeli officials would also want to check all goods coming from Limassol port in Cyprus, the diplomats said.Who would receive the aid would also need to be clarified as there are concerns it could fall into Hamas\\' hands, two diplomats said. Israel would also want to vet what aid was going into Gaza and opposes supplying badly-needed fuel to the enclave, they said.There are also technical issues. Port infrastructure off Gaza was started in 2016, but has since been abandoned. \"Gaza doesn’t have a harbour fit for such purpose,\" said a senior EU official. \"It would require building a floating marina by a country with proper navy experience.\"Should it even go ahead, the mission\\'s safety would need to be ensured and would be likely to need a pause in fighting. FLOATING HOSPITALSOn top of the Cypriot proposal, diplomats said France has also suggested taking the idea further and expanding the corridor to evacuating people who are severely wounded onto hospital ships in the Mediterranean off the coast of Gaza.French officials have said they are discussing the issue with Israeli and Egyptian authorities, but the idea would be to get critical masse from several countries willing to send ships with the necessary medical capacity. Paris is preparing a helicopter carrier for that purpose including beds, surgical capacities, medication and personnel. It is not expected in the region for another 10 days.\"Regarding the humanitarian corridor with France, there is an idea to bring a ship with some medical capabilities.\" Col. Elad Goren, head of Israel’s Civil Department of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), told reporters on Tuesday.\"We are working with the French and with the Egyptians in order to try to build up a mechanism to evacuate wounded people, but it\\'s still ongoing.\"In a letter sent to European counterparts on Nov. 3, Italy\\'s defence minister has also said his country is ready to send a ship equipped with an intensive care ward and surgical capacities as soon as possible, two diplomats said.\"But the question is how you would get evacuated from land to ships?\" said one of the diplomats. \"On the ground first through Egypt or Israel? Directly from Gaza by sea? It\\'s very complex.\"Either way, three diplomats said that hospital ships were essentially only a temporary solution and that the aim would be to eventually set up field hospitals either close to the border in Gaza or on the Egyptian side.\"The Egyptians do not want multiple field hospitals on their side because it could be used as a pretext to push the Palestinians into the Sinai,\" said one diplomat.

       "  'Title': 'The Hamas tunnel city beneath Gaza – a hidden front line for Israel',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM/LONDON - What lies in wait for Israeli ground troops in Gaza, security sources say, is a Hamas tunnel network hundreds of kilometres long and up to 80m deep, described by one freed hostage as “a spider’s web” and by one expert as the “Viet Cong times 10”.The Palestinian militant group has different kinds of tunnels running beneath the sandy 360 sq km coastal strip and its borders.These include attack, smuggling, storage and operational burrows, Western and Middle East sources familiar with the matter said.The United States believes Israel’s special forces will face an unprecedented challenge having to battle Hamas militants while trying to avoid killing hostages held below ground, a US official said.US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin noted that Iraq’s nine-month-long battle to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State might prove to have been easier than what awaits the Israelis – likely to be “a lot of IEDs (improvised explosive devices), a lot of booby traps, and just a really grinding activity”.Israel has invested heavily in\\xa0tunnel detection – including a sensor-equipped underground barrier it called an “iron wall”.But Hamas is still thought to have working tunnels to the outside world.After the last round of hostilities in 2021, Hamas’s leader in Gaza Yahya Al-Sinwar said: “They started saying they destroyed 100km of Hamas tunnels. I am telling you, the tunnels we have in the Gaza Strip exceed 500km. Even if their narrative is true, they only destroyed 20 per cent of the tunnels.”Hostage witnessThere has been no corroboration of the comment by Mr Sinwar, who is thought to be hiding underground ahead of an expected Israeli ground offensive.But the estimate of hundreds of kilometres is widely accepted by security analysts, even though the blockaded coastal strip is only 40km long.With Israel in full control of Gaza’s air and sea access and 59km of its 72km land borders – with Egypt controlling 13km to the south – tunnels provide one of the few ways for Hamas to bring in weapons, equipment and people.While it and other Palestinian groups are secretive about their networks, recently released Israeli hostage, 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz, said: “It looked like a spider’s web, many, many tunnels,” adding: “We walked kilometres under the ground.”Hamas believes that with Israel’s overwhelming aerial and armoured military superiority, tunnels are a way to cut some of those advantages by forcing Israel’s soldiers to move underground in cramped spaces the Hamas fighters know well.An Israeli military spokesperson said on Thursday: “I won’t elaborate on the number of kilometres of tunnels but it is a high number, built under schools and residential areas.”Urging the United Nations Security Council to intervene, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called for an immediate cessation of “aggression” on Gaza, and asked for moves towards “a political solution instead of military and security solutions”.Underground city Israeli security sources say Israel’s heavy aerial bombardments have caused little damage to the tunnel infrastructure, with Hamas naval commandos able to launch a seaborne attack targeting coastal communities near Gaza this week.“Although we have been attacking massively for days and days, the (Hamas) leadership is pretty much intact, as is the ability to command and control, the ability even to try and launch counter-attacks,” said Mr Amir Avivi, a former brigadier general whose senior positions in the Israeli military included deputy commander of the Gaza division, tasked with tackling tunnels.“There is a whole city all over Gaza underneath with depths of 40m to 50m. There are bunkers and headquarters and storage, and of course they are connected to more than a thousand rocket launching positions.”Other sources estimated depths of up to 80m.One Western security source said: “They run for miles. They are made of concrete, and very well made. Think of the Viet Cong times 10. They have had years and lots of money with which to work with.”Another security source from one of Israel’s neighbouring countries said Hamas’s tunnels from Egypt remain active.“The supply chain is still intact these days. The network involved in facilitating coordination (includes) some Egyptian military officers. It is unclear if there is knowledge of this by the Egyptian army,” he said.A small number of narrower deep smuggling tunnels were still operating until recently between Egypt and Gaza, according to two security sources and a trader in the Egyptian city of El Arish, but operations had slowed to a near halt since the Israel-Hamas war started. Egyptian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday\\xa0Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said, while inspecting military units in Suez, that the army’s role was to secure Egyptian borders. \\xa0Long gameHamas was created in Gaza in 1987 and is thought to have begun digging tunnels in the mid-1990s, when Israel granted Mr Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organisation some degree of self-rule in Gaza.The tunnel network is a key reason why Hamas is stronger in Gaza than in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Israel’s settlements, military bases and monitoring devices make it harder to get anything in from Jordan.Tunnelling became easier in 2005 when Israel pulled its soldiers and settlers out of Gaza, and when Hamas won power in a 2006 election.Shortly afterwards, Hamas’s military wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and killed two others after burrowing 600m to raid the Kerem Shalom base on the Gaza border.A year later, Hamas launched a military strike against Mr Arafat’s forces in Gaza using tunnel-mounted attacks.Although the military tunnels remained off-limits to outside eyes, during that era Gaza smugglers would show off their scarcely concealed commercial tunnels under the Rafah border.These were around 1m wide and used winch motors to haul goods along the sandy tunnel floors in hollowed-out petrol barrels.One Rafah tunnel operator, Mr Abu Qusay, said a 800m tunnel took three to six months to dig and could yield profits of up to US$100,000 (S$137,100) a day. The most profitable item was bullets, bought for US$1 each in Egypt and fetched more than US$6 in Gaza. Kalashnikov rifles, he said, cost US$800 in Egypt and sold for twice that.In 2007, the military wing is thought to have brought its commander Mohammed Deif into Gaza through a tunnel from Egypt. Deif was the mastermind behind Hamas’s Oct 7 attack into Israel, which killed 1,400 people.Tunnel huntingProfessor Joel Roskin, a geomorphologist and geologist with Israel’s Bar-Ilan University, said it was difficult to map the tunnel network accurately from the surface or space.He added that highly classified information was essential for 3D mapping and imagery visualisation.Among the elite units tasked with going underground is Yahalom, specialist commandos from Israel’s Combat Engineering Corps known as “weasels” who specialise in finding, clearing and destroying the tunnels.Earlier this week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Yahalom fighters, telling them: “I rely on you, the people of Israel rely on you.”Israeli sources said what awaits them is formidable, and they faced an enemy that has regrouped and learned from previous Israeli operations in 2014 and 2021.“There are going to be a lot of booby traps. They have thermobaric weapons that they didn’t have in 2021, which are more lethal. And I believe they acquired a lot of anti-tank weapon systems that are going to try to hit our APCs (armoured personnel carriers), tanks,” said Mr Amnon Sofrin, a former brigadier general and former commander of the Combat Intelligence Corps.Mr Sofrin, who was also previously head of the intelligence directorate with Israel’s Mossad spy agency, said Hamas would also be trying to kidnap soldiers.Professor Daphne Richemond-Barak at Israel’s Reichman University and author of the book Underground Warfare said the conflicts in Syria and Iraq had changed the situation.“What the IDF (Israeli military) is likely to face inside the tunnels is also all of the experience and all of the knowledge that has been gained by groups like ISIS (Islamic State) and has been... passed on to Hamas.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The nightmare of delivering aid during this Israel-Hamas war',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The 2.3 million people who live in Gaza are facing economic isolation and experiencing incessant bombardment. Their supplies of essential resources, including food and water, are quickly dwindling.In response, US President Joe Biden has pledged US$100 million (S$136 million) in humanitarian assistance for the citizens of Gaza.Mr Biden’s promise raises fundamental questions regarding the delivery of humanitarian aid in a war zone. Political constraints, ethical quandaries and the need to protect the security of aid workers and local communities always make the effort a logistical nightmare.In this specific predicament, US officials have to choose a strategy to deliver the aid without the perception of benefiting Hamas, a group the US and Israel both classify as a terrorist organisation.LogisticsWhen aiding people in war zones, you can’t just send money, a development strategy called “cash transfers” that has become increasingly popular due to its efficiency. Sending money can boost the supply of locally produced goods and services, and help people on the ground pay for what they need most. But injecting cash into an economy so completely cut off from the world would only stoke inflation.So the aid must consist of goods that have to be brought into Gaza, and services provided by people working as part of an aid mission. Humanitarian aid can include food and water; health, sanitation and hygiene supplies and services; and tents and other materials for shelter and settlement.Due to the closure of the border with Israel, aid can arrive in Gaza only via the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border.The US Agency for International Development, or USAid, will likely turn to its long-time partner on the ground, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, to serve as supply depots and distribute goods. That agency, originally founded in 1949 as a temporary measure until a two-state solution could be found, serves in effect as a parallel yet unelected government for Palestinian refugees.USAid will likely want to tap into UNRWA’s network of 284 schools – many of which are now transformed into humanitarian shelters housing two-thirds of the estimated one million people displaced by Israeli air strikes – and 22 hospitals to expedite distribution.PoliticsPrior to the Trump administration, the US was typically the largest single provider of aid to the West Bank and Gaza. USAid administers the lion’s share of it.Since Mr Biden took office, total yearly US assistance for the Palestinian territories has totalled around US$150 million, restored from just US$8 million in 2020 under the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, however, the US was providing more aid to the territories than it is now, with US$1 billion disbursed in the 2013 fiscal year.But the White House needs Congress to approve this assistance – a process that requires the House of Representatives to elect a new Speaker and then for lawmakers to approve aid to Gaza once that happens.EthicsThe UNRWA is a UN organisation. It is not run by Hamas, unlike, for instance, the Gaza Ministry of Health. However, Hamas has frequently undermined UNRWA’s efforts and diverted international aid for military purposes.  Hamas has repeatedly used UNRWA schools as rocket depots. It has repeatedly tunnelled beneath UNRWA schools. It has dismantled European Union-funded water pipes to use as rocket fuselages. And even since the most recent violence broke out, the UNRWA has accused Hamas of stealing fuel and food from its Gaza premises.Humanitarian aid professionals regularly have to contend with these trade-offs when deciding to what extent they can work with governments and local authorities that commit violent acts. They need to do so in exchange for the access required to help civilians under their control.Similarly, Mr Biden has had to make concessions to Israel while brokering for the freedom to send humanitarian aid to Gaza. For example, he has assured Israel that if any of the aid is diverted by Hamas, the operation will cease.This promise may have been politically necessary. But if Mr Biden already believes Hamas to be uncaring about civilian welfare, he may not expect the group to refrain from taking what it can.Security best practicesWhat can be done to protect the security of humanitarian aid operations that take place in the midst of dangerous conflicts?Under international humanitarian law, the local authorities have the primary responsibility for ensuring the delivery of aid – even when they aren’t carrying out that task. To increase the chances that the local authorities will not attack them, aid groups can give “humanitarian notification” and voluntarily alert the local government as to where they will be operating.Hamas has repeatedly flouted international norms and laws. So the question of if and how the aid convoy will be protected looms large.Under the current agreement between the US, Israel and Egypt, the convoy will raise the UN flag. International inspectors will make sure no weapons are on board the vehicles before they cross over from Arish, Egypt, to Rafah, a city located on the Gaza Strip’s border with Egypt.The aid convoy will likely cross without militarised security. This puts it at some danger of diversion once inside Gaza. But whether the aid convoy is attacked, seized or left alone, the Biden administration will have demonstrated its willingness to attempt a humanitarian relief operation. In this sense, a relatively small first convoy bearing water, medical supplies and food, among other items, serves as a test balloon for a sustained operation to follow soon after.If the US were to provide the humanitarian convoy a military escort, by contrast, Hamas could see its presence as a provocation. Washington’s support for Israel is so strong that the US could potentially be judged as a party in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.In that case, the presence of US armed forces might provoke attacks on Gaza-bound aid convoys by Hamas  fighters that otherwise would not have occurred. Combined with the mobilisation of two US Navy carrier groups in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, I’d be concerned that such a move might also stoke regional anger. It would undermine the Biden administration’s attempts to cool the situation.On UN-approved missions, aid delivery may be secured by third-party peacekeepers – meaning, in this case, personnel who are neither Israeli nor Palestinian – with the UN Security Council’s blessing. In this case, tragically, it is unlikely that such a resolution could conceivably pass such a vote, much less quickly enough to make a difference.Topher L.

       "  'Title': 'Palestinian Americans fundraise for Gaza, as aid groups receive record donations',\n",
       "  'Text': 'NEW YORK – Palestinian Americans and aid groups in the United States are raising funds for Gaza, which faces a deepening humanitarian crisis as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth week – but they have as yet limited ability to get supplies into the besieged enclave.Aid organisations that serve civilians in Gaza say they are receiving record amounts of donations in a sign of public support for relief efforts, even as a growing stock of supplies remains stalled at Egypt’s Rafah border crossing.In the Gaza Strip, where 2.3 million people live, civilians are in dire need of clean water, food and medicine, emergency medics say. Half of Gaza’s population was already living in poverty before the crisis.“We’ve seen a significant increase in donations, unlike (anything) we’ve ever seen before,” said Mr Steve Sosebee, president of the US-based Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which has a staff headcount of 40 in Gaza, who provide medical support.He said the fund, which usually has an annual budget of around US$12 million (S$16.45 million), had raised US$15 million in just 10 days.However, with a web of political and logistical obstacles on getting aid in, much of the money and supplies intended for Gaza is in limbo, forcing aid groups to wait as they amass truckloads of goods.Hamas militants burst over the Gaza border and rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people and taking 229 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.In response, Israel launched its most intense air bombardment campaign on the tiny enclave, along with a “total siege”, banning food, water and fuel imports.Aid groups say they are building up supplies in hopes of eventually getting them through to civilians in Gaza, nearly half of whom are children.There has been “a five-fold increase in the total number of donors versus typical past emergencies”, said Mr Derek Madsen, chief development\\xa0officer of Anera, a non-partisan emergency relief group for refugees throughout the Middle East.The organisation, which maintains the privacy of individual donors, said it had recently received the largest single donation from an individual in its 55-year history.The majority of support comes from donors based in the US, he added, with individual donations averaging around US$138. The efforts mirror those of Jewish groups in the US and Canada, who also fundraised millions for Israel.Anera was using the last of its stocks this week to distribute meals and vegetable parcels in Gaza. Its staff of 12, like everyone in Gaza, were facing “unbelievable, unimaginable trauma”, he said.Glued to the televisionIn Ann Arbor, Michigan, Ms Rabia Shafie, national director of the Palestine Aid Society, said her group was speaking to student and Muslim groups on local university campuses and community centres to spread awareness and raise donations for the Red Crescent and UNRWA, the United Nations aid agency that serves Palestinian refugees.“The money is needed to help people survive at this point of time. Medical support is so essential,” she said.“People are glued to the television... watching the news moment to moment, and very stressed out over the situation,” said Ms Rabia, adding that it was difficult as a Palestinian American to watch “the massacre and injustice done to our people back home”.Hamas-governed Gaza is one of the most densely packed places on Earth, and its medical authorities say over 8,000 Palestinians have been killed since air strikes began, including more than 3,000 children.Mr Madsen called for a ceasefire and establishment of a humanitarian corridor “so that people literally do not starve to death, literally do not die of dehydration”.Last week, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, home to one of New York’s largest Muslim and Arab communities, hundreds of protesters called for a ceasefire with signs written in Arabic, Spanish, Hebrew and Korean.In Clifton, New Jersey, the Palestinian American Community Centre’s priorities are calling for US officials to support a ceasefire, and the hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza, said Ms Basma Bsharat, the education director of the centre.The centre has also been collecting cash donations to send on to UNRWA. It has asked people not to donate supplies, which it has no easy way of sending to those in need in Gaza.Last week, a woman came to the centre anyway, hauling bags filled with goods.  “We didn’t know how to say no,” said Ms Basma. “She was like, I just want to do something. I just want to help somehow.”“It’s a very difficult time, and the fact that we do see the support coming in it, it gives some relief,” she said. “It gives some kind of solace.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Scaling up Gaza aid effort faces tangle of challenges',\n",
       "  'Text': 'CAIRO - With a trickle of aid flowing into the besieged Gaza Strip from Egypt, humanitarian staff and diplomats face a web of political, security and logistical obstacles as they try to build up and sustain deliveries of relief.The aid is desperately needed. Supplies of food, water, medicines and fuel have been running critically low for Gaza\\'s 2.3 million people since Israel began its bombardment and \"total siege\" of the Palestinian enclave.Israel’s action is in retaliation for an attack by Hamas militants on Oct 7. But Israel\\'s conditions for inspecting and tracking the aid, security risks transporting and distributing it, and arrangement of its passage through a crossing not used during previous conflicts for large-scale relief efforts have all hampered work to get the operation off the ground.Aid began flowing through Rafah, the main exit and entry point for Gaza that does not border Israel, on Oct 21, with up to 20 trucks crossing daily since. United Nations officials say 100 trucks are required daily to meet essential needs.During past conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, aid had mainly been delivered through crossing points with Israel.The UN aid operation for the Palestinian territories has been run through Israel since the 1950s.Now aid needs to be brought in from Egypt\\'s Sinai Peninsula, an isolated region with a recent history of insurgent attacks and a heavily militarised border. \"It\\'s a huge, huge undertaking to set up a humanitarian operation\\xa0from\\xa0scratch,\" said one aid official who asked not to be named. \"We\\'re not set up like that, not even close, from the\\xa0Egyptian\\xa0side.\"BottlenecksThe aid operation was brokered in talks involving the United States, Israel and Egypt, with a deal to start with a convoy of 20 trucks clinched during a visit by US President Joe Biden to Israel last week, aid officials and diplomats say.As it began, details of an inspection system were still being worked out.Scaling up aid required a quick and light system based on random checks, such as that used for sending aid from Turkey into north-western Syria, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said.Trucks are currently driving more than 40km south along the Egypt-Israel border to be inspected before returning to Gaza.This means a lag of several hours between their entry into the crossing on the Egyptian side and their exit into Gaza. \"There are bottlenecks,\" said Ms Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, which brought some supplies into Gaza with the first convoys but has many more waiting on the Egyptian side of the border.\"What exactly are these bottlenecks? It\\'s very unclear, but I think a lot of it is basically, probably the inspection mechanism and the ability of movement inside Gaza,\" she said.Some Gaza bakeries the WFP works with have been put out of operation because of shortages of fuel, a commodity that has so far not been allowed to cross because of Israeli concerns that it could be used by Hamas.Fuel is also crucial for hospital generators and water supplies, and is fast running out.    US Special Envoy David Satterfield, who has been negotiating with Israel, Egypt and the UN to set up sustained aid deliveries, told MSNBC on Oct 22 that while the critical role of fuel was understood, the provision of food, water and medicine would continue to be the focus \"in the immediate future\".Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.BattlefieldThe US, along with other countries, has also been negotiating to get thousands of foreign passport holders out of Gaza through Rafah.Qatar has meanwhile been leading efforts for the release of hostages taken by Hamas militants during the Oct 7 attack.Two Egyptian security sources linked scaling up of aid to Hamas\\'s willingness to free hostages. From a total of more than 200 hostages, two were freed through Rafah late on Monday, with Hamas crediting Qatar and Egypt for their mediation. Two others were released last week.  The UN says delivery of aid should be unconditional.  On the Gaza side of the border, distribution will depend on the pattern of the conflict and mass displacement of residents, which could be further complicated by an expected Israeli ground operation. As intense bombardment continues, aid organisations have appealed for a humanitarian pause or ceasefire to deliver relief. Security guarantees, especially for northern Gaza where Israeli bombing is concentrated, had not been forthcoming, said Mr Rick Brennan, emergencies director for the World Health Organization. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says 35 of its staff have been killed in Gaza since Oct 7.Bombardment has damaged roads and buildings around Rafah. Not long after Sunday\\'s convoy of trucks entered the crossing, shelling from an Israeli tank hit an Egyptian position nearby, wounding several Egyptian border guards. Israel said the incident was an accident.\"We\\'re going to have to adapt the whole logistics of the operation according to what is transpiring on the battlefield,\" said Mr Griffiths. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – As part of efforts to help the victims of the conflict in Gaza, the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) will be sending US$200,000 (S$273,000) worth of relief supplies to the war zone.The SRC said on Tuesday that the relief supplies will include items such as hygiene kits, clean water, food provisions, and medical consumables and equipment such as wheelchairs.The SRC has also deployed a staff member to Cairo, Egypt, to work with the Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC) in identifying immediate and critical needs in Gaza, and to facilitate the delivery of relief supplies in the coming days.The SRC and ERC are working closely to coordinate humanitarian aid into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing – the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.They are also scaling up efforts to provide more humanitarian assistance, the SRC said.Food, water and medical supplies have been coming through the Egyptian border, but the provided aid is simply too small to meet the huge needs on the ground, according to reports.Affected communities in the Gaza Strip have received limited humanitarian aid, said the SRC statement, adding that the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has been working under “challenging conditions” to deliver emergency assistance such as ambulance and healthcare services.“There are severe shortages of essential necessities such as fuel, water and food, while medical supplies are depleting rapidly,” said the SRC.“While some humanitarian aid has arrived in Gaza with support from the ERC and PRCS, it remains inadequate to meet the extensive needs.”SRC chief executive Benjamin William said: “We are deeply concerned about the suffering and anguish experienced by the people in Gaza. Families, children, women and the elderly are enduring unimaginable hardships.”Many victims have to walk long distances to reach safe areas and have no access to basic necessities such as shelter and water, he said.He added that damaged infrastructure and a “communication paralysis” have exacerbated the crisis, leaving victims disconnected from the outside world.“We continue to urge all parties involved to uphold their responsibilities as outlined in international humanitarian law, and prioritise the protection of civilians,” said Mr William, adding that it is important for hospitals, doctors, nurses and humanitarian workers to be protected as well.“It is essential that all parties recognise and enable unhindered critical humanitarian aid into Gaza for all the affected communities, including those who have been displaced.” Two weeks ago, the SRC launched a public fund-raising appeal for relief and recovery operations, which will close on Jan 31, 2024.The organisation earlier pledged US$150,000 to relief efforts, while the Singapore Government contributed $300,000 towards relief operations through the SRC.Members of the public who wish to make an online donation can visit redcross.sg/gazaresponse',\n",

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Singapore has expressed its support for the efforts of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to sustain the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and calls for all innocent civilian lives to be protected, said Singapore’s Ambassador to the UN Burhan Gafoor.“At the outset, I wish to express Singapore’s utmost support for the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to sustain the flow of humanitarian assistance to the civilians affected by this terrible tragedy in Gaza,” said Mr Gafoor.“We commend the Secretary-General for his leadership role in facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance and recognise the important contributions made by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations on the ground,” he noted.He added that Singapore supports all efforts to defuse tensions in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict.“Respect for the UN Charter and for international law has always been a fundamental guiding principle of Singapore’s foreign policy. The UN Charter and international law provide the foundation for international peace and security,” Mr Gafoor said.The ambassador made these comments at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, as Singapore voted in support of a resolution drafted by Arab states calling for an immediate humanitarian truce.The non-binding resolution received 121 votes in favour, while 44 abstained and 14 – including Israel and the United States – voted “no”. Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s retaliatory action has killed more than 7,000 people in Gaza, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry. Mr Gafoor said: “We mourn the loss and suffering of so many innocent civilians, including children and the elderly. This attack (by Hamas) cannot be condoned or justified by any rationale. We condemn this terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms. We also call for the immediate and safe release of all hostages taken by Hamas.“In this regard, it is worth recalling that just in June this year, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,” he noted. This, he said, calls for the international community to reiterate its “strong and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes”.Israel has the legitimate right to defend its citizens and its territory under international law, said Mr Gafoor.However, he also pointed out that Israel also has an obligation to comply with international humanitarian law.\\xa0“All parties must abide by international humanitarian law and do their utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians,” said the ambassador.He added that Singapore welcomes all efforts to establish and uphold safe zones and routes that will keep civilians out of harm’s way and allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. “Singapore is deeply saddened by the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the loss of so many civilian lives. This is a massive humanitarian crisis,” said Mr Gafoor.“We urge all parties involved to allow the rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and essential services to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” he added. To support humanitarian relief operations in Gaza, the Government has made a financial contribution through the Singapore Red Cross, said Mr Gafoor. Many Singaporeans have also made their own contributions to relief operations, he said, noting that it is the Republic’s hope that their contributions will reach those in need quickly. On the resolution, Mr Gafoor said that Singapore has voted in favour after very careful consideration, but added that the Republic deeply regrets that this resolution has “two glaring and significant omissions”. “First, it makes no mention of Hamas’ role in perpetrating the massive and coordinated terror attacks, which led to the brutal killing of 1,400 Israelis and others and the abduction of more than 200 hostages,” he said.“These are acts of terror that we condemn unequivocally, and the abhorrent deeds of Hamas cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever,” said the ambassador, as he reiterated Singapore’s call for the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all civilians taken hostage. “Second, this resolution\\xa0does not acknowledge Israel’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory in compliance with international law. As with every country, Israel has a right to defend itself from heinous terrorist attacks, to protect its people from senseless violence and to keep its territory secure,” he added.Nevertheless, Singapore supported the resolution as the Republic has “always been a consistent advocate and defender of international law, the UN Charter and the rules-based multilateral system”, said Mr Gafoor.\\xa0\\xa0He pointed out that the resolution reaffirms all parties’ obligations to respect and uphold international law, including international humanitarian law. “It expresses strong support for the efforts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and for his calls for the immediate and unrestricted access of humanitarian aid, and to respond to the most basic needs of the Palestinian civilian population amidst the unfolding humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip,” said Mr Gafoor.The resolution, he said, demands that all parties immediately and fully comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law.\\xa0“These obligations have been spelt out in many UN Security Council resolutions. All innocent civilian lives must be protected,” he stressed.On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr Gafoor said that it is a “longstanding one, and it must be resolved in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. He called it the only way to stop the repeated cycles of violence. “Singapore’s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been consistent. We continue to hold the view that the only viable path to a durable, just and comprehensive solution is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” he said. Mr Gafoor also stressed that Singapore calls on leaders from both sides to show leadership, to exercise restraint and to take the difficult but necessary steps towards the vision of a two-state solution.“We support the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland, and Israel’s right to live within secure borders. Both Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, security and dignity,” he added.',\n",

       "  'Text': 'A breakdown in civil order has put four U.N. aid distribution centres and a storage facility out of action in Gaza as people  search desperately for food and water, a U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) official said on Monday.Tom White, director of UNWRA Affairs in Gaza, also said that a logistics base at the Rafah border crossing vital to aid distribution had become increasingly difficult to operate because 8,000 people were sheltering at it.\"With the breakdown of civil order, every day now we\\'ve got hundreds of people trying to get into the warehouses to steal flour,\" he told Reuters.\"Right now people are in survival mode. It\\'s about getting enough flour and it\\'s about getting enough water.\"Thousands of Gaza residents broke into U.N. warehouses on Sunday to seize flour and other items. One of the warehouses, in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, is where UNRWA stores supplies delivered by humanitarian convoys crossing into Gaza from Egypt.\"Effectively, we have lost Deir al-Balah. We\\'ll see whether we can get that up and operational again,\\xa0but of course\\xa0it\\'s complicated because right now the Rafah log (logistics) base has become a magnet for people who are either seeking shelter, seeking protection under the UN flag, or are trying to get into the warehouses to get flour,\" White said.Aid to Gaza has been choked since Israel began bombarding the Palestinian enclave in response to an attack by the Hamas militant group on Oct. 7 that killed 1,400 people.There has been a mounting international outcry over the toll from the bombing. Medical authorities in Hamas-run Gaza, which has a population of 2.3 million people, said on Monday that 8,306 people - including 3,457 minors - had been killed.The Palestinian Red Crescent said so far 140 trucks of aid had entered Gaza since Oct. 7 and the biggest delivery so far of 33 trucks arrived on Sunday.But U.N. officials say at least 100 trucks a day are required to cover Gaza\\'s urgent needs. Before the war several hundred trucks were normally arriving in Gaza daily.Aid entering from Egypt is being driven on a round-trip of more than 84 km (52 miles) from Rafah for inspection on the Egypt-Israel border, triggering Egyptian complaints.Israel says it does not want aid to enter from its territory or to fall into the hands of Hamas, refusing delivery of fuel, water supplies and relief distribution in Gaza.  On Sunday U.S. President Joe Biden and Egypt\\'s Abdel Fattah al-Sisi committed to a significant acceleration of assistance. Several dozen trucks set off from the Egyptian side of Rafah on Monday, humanitarian and security sources said.   COLLAPSE OF SERVICESBut White said that due to delays, the situation was so bad that more aid was no longer a solution to Gaza\\'s plight. A humanitarian ceasefire was needed, he said.\"With a collapse of public services, that\\'s not going to be something that\\'s going to be solved by food, water or medicine. If the public sector collapses here, you\\'re into a different magnitude of need,\" he saidUNRWA was unable to distribute flour to bakers on Sunday and was down to distributing one litre of potable water per person to displaced people, he said, adding that in a humanitarian response a survival rate was three litres per day. White said Gaza\\'s south had been overwhelmed by an influx of displaced people from the north.Access on roads was reasonable in the south but increasingly difficult in the north due to damage and security as Israeli forces attacked Gaza\\'s main northern city.Tommaso Della Longa, spokesperson of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said Gaza was in desperate condition.\"The longer it continues the more we will see desperation,\" he said. \"If you are not able to get supplies to people who are starving, people will find a way.\" REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON - Israel\\'s war Cabinet has agreed to allow 140,000 litres of fuel into Gaza every two days, after a request from Washington, amid acute shortages that threatened aid deliveries and communications in the besieged strip, Israel and US officials said on Friday.Israel imposed a strict blockade on all goods entering Hamas-controlled Gaza when it launched a military campaign in response to the Palestinian militant group\\'s Oct 7 rampage, in which they killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages.Israel has since agreed to allow in aid trucks after stringent inspections, and a small amount of fuel was allowed in on Wednesday to keep United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) aid delivery trucks moving.An Israeli official who declined to be identified said two trucks a day would be allowed in to meet the UN\\'s needs, but said the amount would give \"minimal\" support for water, sewage and sanitary systems in Gaza to prevent pandemics.A US State Department official, offering more details, said Israel had committed to allowing in 120,000 litres of fuel every 48 hours for UNRWA\\'s trucks and other needs like desalinisation of water, sewage pumping, bakeries and hospitals in the south of Gaza.An additional 20,000 litres every two days would be allowed in to power generators of telecoms company Paltel, which had warned of an imminent blackout of its cellphone network due to lack of fuel. US officials have been pushing Israel to allow fuel in for some time. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken made calls to members of Israel\\'s war Cabinet on Wednesday, and warned that the fuel shortage risked a humanitarian catastrophe among Gaza\\'s 2.3 million residents, the State Department official said. Israeli officials had previously argued that Hamas should release hostages before it eased the pressure on Gaza, the official said, adding that negotiations on the release of hostages continue separate from the move on fuel.    The Israeli official confirmed the decision came after a request from Washington, and said allowing the fuel in gives Israel extra room to maneuver in the international arena so it can continue its campaign to eradicate Hamas in Gaza.

       "  'Title': 'Israel PM Netanyahu rejects Gaza ceasefire, says it amounts to ‘surrendering to Hamas’',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday a ceasefire in the Israel’s war against Hamas “will not happen”, as the United Nations warned not enough aid was coming in to meet “unprecedented humanitarian needs”.Israeli ground forces fought inside the Gaza Strip and air strikes pounded the besieged Hamas-run Palestinian territory in response to the Oct 7 attack – the deadliest in Israel’s history.The intensifying military operations have sharply heightened fears for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza, where the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says more than 8,300 have been killed.In a briefing to foreign press, Mr Netanyahu said a ceasefire would amount to surrendering to Hamas, whose gunmen killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages, according to the latest Israeli figures.“Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen,” he said, vowing Israel will “fight until this battle is won”.The United States, Israel’s ally, also objected to a ceasefire.“We do not believe that a ceasefire is the right answer right now,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, adding that “pauses” to get aid into Gaza should be considered instead.As Israeli forces battled Hamas militants inside the narrow Palestinian territory and sent tanks to the outskirts of Gaza City, concern has surged about the widening humanitarian crisis.Mr Kirby said Washington was “confident” of increasing the number of aid trucks to Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt to around 100 a day.Limited aid has entered Gaza from Egypt under a US-brokered deal, but its volume has fallen far short of the hundreds of trucks a day aid agencies say are needed.Mr Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, called for the Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs,” he said.Israeli tanks on Gaza highway The Hamas attack set off the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, marked by weeks of withering aerial bombardment and three continuous nights of ground operations centred on northern Gaza, which Israel has told civilians to evacuate.Columns of Israeli tanks and armoured bulldozers were seen churning through the sand, and snipers took positions inside emptied residential buildings, in footage released by the army.Dozens of tanks advanced for more than an hour into the southern fringes of Gaza City and blocked the main north-south highway, “firing at any vehicle that tries to go on it”, an eyewitness told AFP by phone.Air strikes also cratered the road and brought down buildings, residents said, before the tanks withdrew.The Israeli ground forces were supported by heavy fire from the air and artillery, with the army striking more than 600 targets within 24 hours, up from 450 reported by the military a day earlier.Hamas said it had fired anti-tank missiles at two Israeli armoured vehicles and that “blows delivered by the resistance have prevented” Israeli troops from establishing a presence in Gaza.The Israeli military also said a woman soldier was rescued from captivity after an operation in the Hamas-run territory. The release of Ms Ori Megidish was “secured during a ground operation”, the army said, adding that she had been “medically checked” and was “doing well”.Mr Netanyahu said the international community must demand the captives remaining in Gaza “be freed immediately, unconditionally”.Hamas released a video of what it said were three women hostages, seated against a tile wall, although the time and place of the recording could not be verified.One called in an agitated tone for Mr Netanyahu to agree to Hamas’ proposed exchange of the hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Mr Netanyahu decried the clip as “cruel psychological propaganda”.‘Bombing followed us’ The more than 230 hostages – aged between a few months and above 80 – are believed to be held in a network of underground tunnels where Hamas has hid its military infrastructure from Israeli surveillance and air attacks.Israel confirmed the death of one of those missing – German-Israeli Shani Louk, 23, who was captured by Hamas when its gunmen stormed a desert music festival.Fear and desperation have spiralled in Gaza, under weeks of siege that have cut off water, food, fuel and other essentials.Internet access was severed on Friday but restored on Sunday following US pressure, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.“We made clear to the government of Israel over the weekend that communications networks needed to be restored,” he said on Monday. “It is about ensuring that vital information flows, humanitarian coordination continues and families can stay in touch.”The UN reported on Sunday that “thousands of people” had ransacked aid warehouses in Gaza.Donkey carts were lining up to load water, as safe drinking water has become scarce in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.According to the UN, all 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders – despite sheltering thousands of patients and about 117,000 displaced people.“We were displaced from our homes to the hospital,” Gaza City resident Ashraf al-Muzani, 38, said from Al-Quds hospital where he and his family have sheltered for a week. “The bombing followed us,” he added. “We haven’t been able to sleep and our children are so frightened.”‘Highest’ UN death toll Mr Lazzarini said 64 of his colleagues had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, “the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict in such a short time”.Anti-Israel anger has flared across the region and beyond.In Russia’s Muslim-majority Dagestan, police said they had arrested 60 people after a crowd stormed an airport on Sunday to attack passengers arriving from Tel Aviv.And Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the US of being responsible for what he called “deadly chaos” unfolding in the Middle East.Washington has warned Israel’s enemies – in particular Iran-allied groups – not to become more fully involved after a series of attacks across the region. Israel’s military has struck targets in Syria and traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told AFP he was “doing my duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war”.Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank where health officials say about 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire and in settler attacks since the Gaza war started.

       "  'Title': 'Israel ramps up strikes on Hamas, US urges ‘continuous flow’ of aid to Gaza',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/WASHINGTON - Israel’s military intensified its assault on Hamas militants in Gaza, as the United States and other global powers called for aid to continue flowing into the besieged strip to prevent an already grave humanitarian crisis from worsening.Israel’s military said it had hit more than 400 militant targets in Gaza overnight and killed dozens of Hamas fighters, including three deputy battalion commanders.In a statement, the military said that among the targets hit was a tunnel which allowed Hamas to infiltrate Israel from the sea and Hamas command centres in mosques. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.Earlier, Israeli Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi suggested Israel has no intention of curbing its strikes on the densely populated Gaza Strip.He also hinted the country is well-prepared for a ground assault.“We want to bring Hamas to a state of full dismantling,” Mr Haveli said. “The path is a path of unrelenting attacks, damaging Hamas everywhere and in every way.“We are well-prepared for the ground operations in the south,” he added, referring to southern Israel which abuts Gaza. “There are tactical, operative, strategic considerations that have provided additional time, and troops who have more time are better prepared, and that is what we are doing now.”The Palestinian health ministry said the Gaza death toll in two weeks of air strikes has surpassed 5,000.The Israeli bombardment was triggered by a Hamas assault on Oct 7 that killed more than 1,400 people. Gunmen from the militant group also took some 200 people hostage.Hamas on Monday freed two Israeli women. US President Joe Biden welcomed the release of the hostages.He also underscored the need to sustain “a continuous flow” of humanitarian assistance into Gaza in a telephone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said.On its part, China called for a “more authoritative, wide-ranging and effective international peace conference” soon, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki in a telephone call.A Cairo peace summit on Saturday saw Arab leaders condemn Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, but fail to agree on a joint statement. Absent were Israel and the US.In public, the United States has stressed Israel’s right to defend itself.But two sources familiar with the matter said the White House, Pentagon and State Department have stepped up private appeals for caution in conversations with the Israelis.A US priority is to gain time for negotiations to free other hostages.Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, US President Joe Biden said: ““We should have those hostages released and then we can talk.”At least 10 British nationals have been killed in the conflict between Israel and Hamas and a further six remain missing, junior British finance minister Victoria Atkins told Times Radio on Tuesday.Obama warns Israel against civilian casualtiesIn a rare comment by a former US president, Mr Barack Obama has warned that “any Israeli military strategy that ignores the human costs could ultimately backfire”.He issued a written statement warning Israel not to cause so many civilian casualties in retaliating against Hamas that it would alienate generations of Palestinians.“Any Israeli military strategy that ignores the human costs could ultimately backfire. Already, thousands of Palestinians have been killed in the bombing of Gaza, many of them children. Hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes,” Mr Obama said the a statement posted on social media.It is not immediately clear whether Mr Obama coordinated his statement with Mr Biden, who was his vice-president. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“The Israeli government’s decision to cut off food, water and electricity to a captive civilian population threatens not only to worsen a growing humanitarian crisis,” he added.“It could further harden Palestinian attitudes for generations, erode global support for Israel, play into the hands of Israel’s enemies, and undermine long term efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region,” he wrote in the statement published in Medium that also condemned Hamas’s attack and reiterated his support for Israel’s right to defend itself.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken planned on Tuesday to attend a UN Security Council meeting on the Middle East.It is unclear what action, if any, might be taken by the council, whose five veto-wielding powers appear divided.Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has allowed China and Russia to burnish their credentials as the champions of the developing world, in contrast with the US, which has squarely supported Israel. All three big powers hold Council vetoes.Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Tel Aviv on Tuesday to express his country’s “full solidarity” with Israel. He is also expected to call for the “preservation of the civilian population” in Gaza.With Gaza’s 2.3 million people running short of basics, European leaders looked set to follow the United Nations and Arab nations in calling for a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities so aid could reach them.A convoy of humanitarian aid trucks delivered water, food and medicine to the Gaza Strip on Monday, the third since aid began flowing on Saturday.But the United Nations said fuel was not included and reserves will run out within two days.The UN said desperate Gazans also lacked places to shelter from the unrelenting pounding that has flattened swathes of the Hamas-ruled enclave.The conflict meanwhile is escalating beyond Gaza.Israeli aircraft hit positions in south Lebanon held by Hezbollah which, like Hamas, is a group allied to Israel’s long-time foe Iran. The Israeli army and Palestinians also clashed in the occupied West Bank and Hamas fired more rockets into Israel.Hostages freedThe two women Hamas released on Monday were the third and fourth hostages to be freed. “We decided to release them for humanitarian and poor health grounds,” Mr Abu Ubaida, spokesman for the armed wing of the Palestinian Hamas militant group, said on Telegram.The Israeli prime minister’s office issued a statement confirming that the women, whom it named as Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, were handed over to the Israeli military and would be taken to a medical facility.The two were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, near Gaza, along with their husbands, who are still held by Hamas, it added. Hamas freed the two elderly women after releasing an American woman and her daughter on Friday.Fighting inside GazaIsrael said its armed forces’ incursions overnight were partly intended to gather intelligence, with the whereabouts of the hostages unknown, and had helped improve its military readiness.“These raids are raids that kill squads of terrorists who are preparing for our next stage in the war. These are raids that go deep,” military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said.Hamas’s armed wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters engaged with an Israeli force that infiltrated southern Gaza, destroying two bulldozers and a tank and forcing the raiders to withdraw.Israel made no comment on the incident.The Al-Qassam Brigades also said they were firing missiles at the southern Israeli towns of Ashkelon and Mavki’im. Warning sirens sounded on the Israeli side.The Israeli military, the Middle East’s most powerful, faces a group that has built up a large arsenal with Iran’s help, fighting in a crowded urban setting and using a vast tunnel network.The UN humanitarian office (OCHA) said about 1.4 million of Gaza’s population - more than half - are now internally displaced.Many are seeking refuge in overcrowded UN emergency shelters.Israel has ordered Gaza residents to evacuate the north. But many who had fled appeared to be returning north due to increased bombardments in the south and lack of shelter.“They told us to evacuate your place and go to Khan Younis because it is safe... They betrayed us and bombed us,” said 18-year-old Dima Al-Lamdani who lost her parents, seven siblings and four members of her uncle’s family in an air strike after the family moved south.Spreading violence Early on Monday, Israeli warplanes also struck two Hezbollah cells in Lebanon that were planning to launch missiles and rockets towards Israel, the Israeli military said. Israel also hit a Hezbollah compound and an observation post.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, two Palestinians were killed at the Jalazone refugee camp near Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority health ministry said.Residents told Reuters that Israeli forces raided the camp and made many arrests as they clashed with gunmen and some youths who threw stones. The Israeli military said 15 suspects were captured, 10 of them Hamas operatives. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'GENEVA – \\xa0The United Nations’ high commissioner for human rights on Tuesday condemned allegations of mass killings and executions by Palestinian armed groups, as he warned that Israel’s announcement of a “complete siege” of Gaza would exacerbate the “already dire” humanitarian situation in the coast.“All parties must respect international humanitarian law,” Mr Volker Turk said in a statement. “They must immediately cease attacks targeting civilians and attacks expected to cause disproportionate death and injury of civilians or damage to civilian objects.”As Israeli warplanes struck hundreds of sites on Monday, Israel’s defence minister said “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed into Gaza, which is controlled by the militant group Hamas and is under a 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt that heavily restricts access for people and goods. Mr Turk said the ability of medical facilities to treat the growing number of people wounded in Israeli strikes would be harmed by a “full siege”.  “The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,” he said. He added that restrictions on people and goods must be “justified by military necessity” or may amount to collective punishment.The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza warned on Sunday of large shortages of medicine and health equipment, as well as fuel required to keep hospital electrical generators running.Mr Turk also said he was “deeply shocked and appalled by allegations of summary executions of civilians, and, in some instances, horrifying mass killings by members of Palestinian armed groups”. He called on Palestinian armed factions to immediately release Israeli civilians who were taken hostage. About 150 people are believed to have been abducted by Palestinian gunmen in the attacks that began on Saturday.“It is horrific and deeply distressing to see images of those captured by Palestinian armed groups being ill-treated, as well as reports of killings and the desecration of their bodies,” he said. “Civilians must never be used as bargaining chips.”The World Health Organisation (WHO) called on Tuesday for a humanitarian corridor to be established into and out of the Gaza.The WHO had reported 13 attacks on health facilities in Gaza since the weekend, and that the organisation’s medical supplies stored there had already been used up.\\xa0“WHO is calling for an end to the violence… A humanitarian corridor is needed to reach people with critical medical supplies,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told journalists in Geneva.“We need supplies to come in: hospitals cannot run without fuel, without electricity.“The supplies that we have pre-positioned are already running low so we need those supplies to come,” Mr Jasarevic said.The United Nations humanitarian office said nearly 200,000 people, or nearly a tenth of the population, have fled their homes in Gaza since the start of hostilities.

       "  'Title': 'Aid supplies to Gaza halted again, UN says starvation imminent   ',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM – United Nations aid deliveries to Gaza were suspended again on Nov 17 due to shortages of fuel and a communications shutdown, deepening the misery of thousands of hungry and homeless Palestinians as Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the enclave. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said civilians faced the “immediate possibility of starvation” due to the lack of food supplies. Palestinian news agency Wafa said a number of Palestinians were killed and others injured in an Israeli strike that hit a group of displaced people near the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt – the transit point for aid. Al Jazeera TV cited sources as saying that nine people were killed in the strike. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the reported strike, and Reuters could not verify it.In other developments, Israel said its troops had found a tunnel shaft used by Hamas at Al-Shifa Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip.The hospital, packed with patients and displaced people and struggling to keep operating, has been a major focus of global concern this week. Israel says Hamas has stored weapons and ammunition and is holding hostages in a network of tunnels under hospitals like Shifa, using patients and people taking shelter there as human shields. Hamas denies this.With the war about to enter its seventh week, there is no sign of any let-up despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.The conflict was triggered by a cross-border raid by Hamas militants on Oct 7 that killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, in the deadliest day in the state’s 75-year-history.More than 11,500 Palestinians, at least 4,700 of them children, have now been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military assault on Hamas-ruled Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry – a toll that far surpasses previous bouts of conflict in recent years.Israel has vowed to wipe out the militant group. Whole neighbourhoods of Gaza have been flattened in air and artillery strikes, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, and the humanitarian situation is catastrophic, aid agencies say.Trucks suspendedThe UN said there would be no cross-border aid operation on Nov 17 due to fuel shortages and a communication shutdown.  For a second consecutive day on Nov 16, no aid lorries arrived in Gaza due to lack of fuel for distributing relief.WFP executive director Cindy McCain said nearly the entire population was in desperate need of food assistance.“Supplies of food and water are practically non-existent in Gaza and only a fraction of what is needed is arriving through the borders,” she said in a statement.“With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,” Ms McCain said.A UN human rights official said Israel must allow water and fuel into Gaza to restart the water supply network.“Every hour that passes with Israel preventing the provision of safe drinking water in the Gaza Strip, in brazen breach of international law, puts Gazans at risk of dying of thirst and diseases,” Mr Pedro Arrojo-Agudo said.The World Health Organisation on Nov 17 said it was very worried about the spread of disease in Gaza, citing more than 70,000 reported cases of acute respiratory infections and over 44,000 cases of diarrhoea, far more than expected.The Israeli military’s chief of staff said Israel was close to destroying Hamas’ military system in the northern Gaza Strip, and there were signs the army was taking its campaign to other parts of the coastal enclave of 2.3 million people.Israel accused Hamas of preventing people from heading to the south of the Gaza Strip, which the militant group denied.The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of Al-Shifa, Gaza’s biggest hospital.The video, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a deep hole in the ground, littered with and surrounded by concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.The army said its troops also found a vehicle in the hospital containing a large number of weapons.Reuters journalists have been unable to reach anyone inside Al-Shifa Hospital for more than 24 hours.Hamas on Nov 16 said claims by the United States that the group uses Shifa for military purposes were “a repetition of a blatantly false narrative, demonstrated by the weak and ridiculous performances of the occupation army spokesman”. Israeli officials said Hamas held some of the 240 hostages taken by gunmen on Oct 7 in the hospital complex.On Nov 17 the Israeli military said soldiers retrieved the body of a female soldier who had been held captive in a building near Shifa.The military confirmed her death on Nov 14 after Hamas issued a video of her alive, followed by images of what it said was her body after she was killed in an Israeli strike.On Nov 16, troops recovered the body of another woman hostage, also in a building near Shifa.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Hamas’ Al-Quds Brigades said they had engaged Israeli forces for several hours in the city of Jenin overnight into Nov 17, unleashing a “torrent of fire” and laying ambushes with explosives.Israel’s military said warplanes struck militants in Jenin who had opened fire on Israeli soldiers. It said at least five of the militants were killed.At least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the Oct 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The violence there has underscored fears that the territory, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, could spiral out of control in tandem with the conflict in Gaza. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'WASHINGTON - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Israel on Friday to voice solidarity with its retaliation against Hamas in Gaza but also to reassert the need to minimise Palestinian civilian casualties, his spokesperson said on Wednesday.Mr Blinken\\'s trip, which includes a stop in Jordan, is his second to the Middle East in less than a month.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials and receive an update on Israel\\'s military objectives and its plans to achieve those goals.\"He will reiterate US support for Israel’s right to defend itself in accordance with international humanitarian law, and discuss the need to take all precautions to minimise civilian casualties, as well as our work to deliver humanitarian assistance,\" Mr Miller told reporters.Israel sent ground forces into Hamas-ruled Gaza late last week after weeks of air and artillery strikes to retaliate for the surprise Hamas attack in which Israel says 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 240 were taken hostage.The Gaza health ministry says at least 8,796 Palestinians in the narrow coastal enclave, including 3,648 children, have been killed by Israeli strikes since Oct 7.Mr Blinken, who as Secretary of State is President Joe Biden\\'s top diplomat, will also discuss options on who will run the densely populated enclave if and when Hamas, an Islamist Palestinian militant group, is defeated.White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday that Washington did not believe Hamas could be involved in governing Gaza when the war is over.In Jordan, Mr Blinken will underscore the importance of protecting civilian lives and reiterate a US commitment to ensure Palestinians are not forcibly displaced out of Gaza, a growing concern of the Arab world, Mr Miller said.He will pursue talks led by Egypt and Qatar on securing the release of more than 200 hostages held by Hamas, Mr Miller said.Turkish diplomatic sources said Blinken would also visit Turkey, but Mr Miller did not confirm the additional stop. \"We will make further announcements as they\\'re available in the coming days,\" he added.Mr Blinken was set to depart Washington on Thursday. His last trip to the region that kicked off on Oct 11 was initially announced as a visit to Israel and Jordan but was later expanded to include five more Arab countries, ending up being his most extensive yet trip to the region. Additional stops were often announced within short notice during the week-long whirlwind journey. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'GENEVA  -     The heads of several major United Nations bodies on Monday made a united call for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify nearly one month into the conflict. The 18 signatories include Volker Turk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths.\"An entire population is besieged and under attack, denied access to the essentials for survival, bombed in their homes, shelters, hospitals and places of worship.

       "  'Text': 'NICOSIA/PARIS/BRUSSELS  -     World powers meet in Paris on Thursday to coordinate aid and help for the wounded in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, with the possible creation of a maritime corridor, naval medical facilities and field hospitals to be considered, European diplomats said.A month after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas Islamists that killed 1,400 people in Israel, concern is growing over civilian casualties that have soared under Israel\\'s retaliatory bombardments, with more than 10,000 Palestinians killed, and many more wounded and forced to flee their homes.The conference brings together regional stakeholders such as Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf Arab countries as well as Western powers and G20 members - excluding Russia. International institutions and non-governmental organisations operating in Gaza are also due to attend.The Palestinian Authority will be present but Israel has not been invited, although it will be kept informed of the developments.The broad aim is to mobilise financial resources and find ways to get aid into the enclave, while also getting those seriously wounded out given Gaza\\'s medical infrastructure is fast collapsing. Cyprus, the closest EU member state to Gaza, has put forward an idea to get more aid into Gaza via a maritime corridor. It would expand the limited capacities beyond the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza, but the concept is tricky, four diplomats said. Israeli officials would also want to check all goods coming from Limassol port in Cyprus, the diplomats said.Who would receive the aid would also need to be clarified as there are concerns it could fall into Hamas\\' hands, two diplomats said. Israel would also want to vet what aid was going into Gaza and opposes supplying badly-needed fuel to the enclave, they said.There are also technical issues. Port infrastructure off Gaza was started in 2016, but has since been abandoned. \"Gaza doesn’t have a harbour fit for such purpose,\" said a senior EU official. \"It would require building a floating marina by a country with proper navy experience.\"Should it even go ahead, the mission\\'s safety would need to be ensured and would be likely to need a pause in fighting. FLOATING HOSPITALSOn top of the Cypriot proposal, diplomats said France has also suggested taking the idea further and expanding the corridor to evacuating people who are severely wounded onto hospital ships in the Mediterranean off the coast of Gaza.French officials have said they are discussing the issue with Israeli and Egyptian authorities, but the idea would be to get critical masse from several countries willing to send ships with the necessary medical capacity. Paris is preparing a helicopter carrier for that purpose including beds, surgical capacities, medication and personnel. It is not expected in the region for another 10 days.\"Regarding the humanitarian corridor with France, there is an idea to bring a ship with some medical capabilities.\" Col. Elad Goren, head of Israel’s Civil Department of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), told reporters on Tuesday.\"We are working with the French and with the Egyptians in order to try to build up a mechanism to evacuate wounded people, but it\\'s still ongoing.\"In a letter sent to European counterparts on Nov. 3, Italy\\'s defence minister has also said his country is ready to send a ship equipped with an intensive care ward and surgical capacities as soon as possible, two diplomats said.\"But the question is how you would get evacuated from land to ships?\" said one of the diplomats. \"On the ground first through Egypt or Israel? Directly from Gaza by sea? It\\'s very complex.\"Either way, three diplomats said that hospital ships were essentially only a temporary solution and that the aim would be to eventually set up field hospitals either close to the border in Gaza or on the Egyptian side.\"The Egyptians do not want multiple field hospitals on their side because it could be used as a pretext to push the Palestinians into the Sinai,\" said one diplomat.

       "  'Text': 'NEW YORK – Palestinian Americans and aid groups in the United States are raising funds for Gaza, which faces a deepening humanitarian crisis as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth week – but they have as yet limited ability to get supplies into the besieged enclave.Aid organisations that serve civilians in Gaza say they are receiving record amounts of donations in a sign of public support for relief efforts, even as a growing stock of supplies remains stalled at Egypt’s Rafah border crossing.In the Gaza Strip, where 2.3 million people live, civilians are in dire need of clean water, food and medicine, emergency medics say. Half of Gaza’s population was already living in poverty before the crisis.“We’ve seen a significant increase in donations, unlike (anything) we’ve ever seen before,” said Mr Steve Sosebee, president of the US-based Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which has a staff headcount of 40 in Gaza, who provide medical support.He said the fund, which usually has an annual budget of around US$12 million (S$16.45 million), had raised US$15 million in just 10 days.However, with a web of political and logistical obstacles on getting aid in, much of the money and supplies intended for Gaza is in limbo, forcing aid groups to wait as they amass truckloads of goods.Hamas militants burst over the Gaza border and rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people and taking 229 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.In response, Israel launched its most intense air bombardment campaign on the tiny enclave, along with a “total siege”, banning food, water and fuel imports.Aid groups say they are building up supplies in hopes of eventually getting them through to civilians in Gaza, nearly half of whom are children.There has been “a five-fold increase in the total number of donors versus typical past emergencies”, said Mr Derek Madsen, chief development\\xa0officer of Anera, a non-partisan emergency relief group for refugees throughout the Middle East.The organisation, which maintains the privacy of individual donors, said it had recently received the largest single donation from an individual in its 55-year history.The majority of support comes from donors based in the US, he added, with individual donations averaging around US$138. The efforts mirror those of Jewish groups in the US and Canada, who also fundraised millions for Israel.Anera was using the last of its stocks this week to distribute meals and vegetable parcels in Gaza. Its staff of 12, like everyone in Gaza, were facing “unbelievable, unimaginable trauma”, he said.Glued to the televisionIn Ann Arbor, Michigan, Ms Rabia Shafie, national director of the Palestine Aid Society, said her group was speaking to student and Muslim groups on local university campuses and community centres to spread awareness and raise donations for the Red Crescent and UNRWA, the United Nations aid agency that serves Palestinian refugees.“The money is needed to help people survive at this point of time. Medical support is so essential,” she said.“People are glued to the television... watching the news moment to moment, and very stressed out over the situation,” said Ms Rabia, adding that it was difficult as a Palestinian American to watch “the massacre and injustice done to our people back home”.Hamas-governed Gaza is one of the most densely packed places on Earth, and its medical authorities say over 8,000 Palestinians have been killed since air strikes began, including more than 3,000 children.Mr Madsen called for a ceasefire and establishment of a humanitarian corridor “so that people literally do not starve to death, literally do not die of dehydration”.Last week, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, home to one of New York’s largest Muslim and Arab communities, hundreds of protesters called for a ceasefire with signs written in Arabic, Spanish, Hebrew and Korean.In Clifton, New Jersey, the Palestinian American Community Centre’s priorities are calling for US officials to support a ceasefire, and the hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza, said Ms Basma Bsharat, the education director of the centre.The centre has also been collecting cash donations to send on to UNRWA. It has asked people not to donate supplies, which it has no easy way of sending to those in need in Gaza.Last week, a woman came to the centre anyway, hauling bags filled with goods.  “We didn’t know how to say no,” said Ms Basma. “She was like, I just want to do something. I just want to help somehow.”“It’s a very difficult time, and the fact that we do see the support coming in it, it gives some relief,” she said. “It gives some kind of solace.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The nightmare of delivering aid during this Israel-Hamas war',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The 2.3 million people who live in Gaza are facing economic isolation and experiencing incessant bombardment. Their supplies of essential resources, including food and water, are quickly dwindling.In response, US President Joe Biden has pledged US$100 million (S$136 million) in humanitarian assistance for the citizens of Gaza.Mr Biden’s promise raises fundamental questions regarding the delivery of humanitarian aid in a war zone. Political constraints, ethical quandaries and the need to protect the security of aid workers and local communities always make the effort a logistical nightmare.In this specific predicament, US officials have to choose a strategy to deliver the aid without the perception of benefiting Hamas, a group the US and Israel both classify as a terrorist organisation.LogisticsWhen aiding people in war zones, you can’t just send money, a development strategy called “cash transfers” that has become increasingly popular due to its efficiency. Sending money can boost the supply of locally produced goods and services, and help people on the ground pay for what they need most. But injecting cash into an economy so completely cut off from the world would only stoke inflation.So the aid must consist of goods that have to be brought into Gaza, and services provided by people working as part of an aid mission. Humanitarian aid can include food and water; health, sanitation and hygiene supplies and services; and tents and other materials for shelter and settlement.Due to the closure of the border with Israel, aid can arrive in Gaza only via the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border.The US Agency for International Development, or USAid, will likely turn to its long-time partner on the ground, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, to serve as supply depots and distribute goods. That agency, originally founded in 1949 as a temporary measure until a two-state solution could be found, serves in effect as a parallel yet unelected government for Palestinian refugees.USAid will likely want to tap into UNRWA’s network of 284 schools – many of which are now transformed into humanitarian shelters housing two-thirds of the estimated one million people displaced by Israeli air strikes – and 22 hospitals to expedite distribution.PoliticsPrior to the Trump administration, the US was typically the largest single provider of aid to the West Bank and Gaza. USAid administers the lion’s share of it.Since Mr Biden took office, total yearly US assistance for the Palestinian territories has totalled around US$150 million, restored from just US$8 million in 2020 under the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, however, the US was providing more aid to the territories than it is now, with US$1 billion disbursed in the 2013 fiscal year.But the White House needs Congress to approve this assistance – a process that requires the House of Representatives to elect a new Speaker and then for lawmakers to approve aid to Gaza once that happens.EthicsThe UNRWA is a UN organisation. It is not run by Hamas, unlike, for instance, the Gaza Ministry of Health. However, Hamas has frequently undermined UNRWA’s efforts and diverted international aid for military purposes.  Hamas has repeatedly used UNRWA schools as rocket depots. It has repeatedly tunnelled beneath UNRWA schools. It has dismantled European Union-funded water pipes to use as rocket fuselages. And even since the most recent violence broke out, the UNRWA has accused Hamas of stealing fuel and food from its Gaza premises.Humanitarian aid professionals regularly have to contend with these trade-offs when deciding to what extent they can work with governments and local authorities that commit violent acts. They need to do so in exchange for the access required to help civilians under their control.Similarly, Mr Biden has had to make concessions to Israel while brokering for the freedom to send humanitarian aid to Gaza. For example, he has assured Israel that if any of the aid is diverted by Hamas, the operation will cease.This promise may have been politically necessary. But if Mr Biden already believes Hamas to be uncaring about civilian welfare, he may not expect the group to refrain from taking what it can.Security best practicesWhat can be done to protect the security of humanitarian aid operations that take place in the midst of dangerous conflicts?Under international humanitarian law, the local authorities have the primary responsibility for ensuring the delivery of aid – even when they aren’t carrying out that task. To increase the chances that the local authorities will not attack them, aid groups can give “humanitarian notification” and voluntarily alert the local government as to where they will be operating.Hamas has repeatedly flouted international norms and laws. So the question of if and how the aid convoy will be protected looms large.Under the current agreement between the US, Israel and Egypt, the convoy will raise the UN flag. International inspectors will make sure no weapons are on board the vehicles before they cross over from Arish, Egypt, to Rafah, a city located on the Gaza Strip’s border with Egypt.The aid convoy will likely cross without militarised security. This puts it at some danger of diversion once inside Gaza. But whether the aid convoy is attacked, seized or left alone, the Biden administration will have demonstrated its willingness to attempt a humanitarian relief operation. In this sense, a relatively small first convoy bearing water, medical supplies and food, among other items, serves as a test balloon for a sustained operation to follow soon after.If the US were to provide the humanitarian convoy a military escort, by contrast, Hamas could see its presence as a provocation. Washington’s support for Israel is so strong that the US could potentially be judged as a party in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.In that case, the presence of US armed forces might provoke attacks on Gaza-bound aid convoys by Hamas  fighters that otherwise would not have occurred. Combined with the mobilisation of two US Navy carrier groups in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, I’d be concerned that such a move might also stoke regional anger. It would undermine the Biden administration’s attempts to cool the situation.On UN-approved missions, aid delivery may be secured by third-party peacekeepers – meaning, in this case, personnel who are neither Israeli nor Palestinian – with the UN Security Council’s blessing. In this case, tragically, it is unlikely that such a resolution could conceivably pass such a vote, much less quickly enough to make a difference.Topher L.

       "  'Title': 'Scaling up Gaza aid effort faces tangle of challenges',\n",
       "  'Text': 'CAIRO - With a trickle of aid flowing into the besieged Gaza Strip from Egypt, humanitarian staff and diplomats face a web of political, security and logistical obstacles as they try to build up and sustain deliveries of relief.The aid is desperately needed. Supplies of food, water, medicines and fuel have been running critically low for Gaza\\'s 2.3 million people since Israel began its bombardment and \"total siege\" of the Palestinian enclave.Israel’s action is in retaliation for an attack by Hamas militants on Oct 7. But Israel\\'s conditions for inspecting and tracking the aid, security risks transporting and distributing it, and arrangement of its passage through a crossing not used during previous conflicts for large-scale relief efforts have all hampered work to get the operation off the ground.Aid began flowing through Rafah, the main exit and entry point for Gaza that does not border Israel, on Oct 21, with up to 20 trucks crossing daily since. United Nations officials say 100 trucks are required daily to meet essential needs.During past conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, aid had mainly been delivered through crossing points with Israel.The UN aid operation for the Palestinian territories has been run through Israel since the 1950s.Now aid needs to be brought in from Egypt\\'s Sinai Peninsula, an isolated region with a recent history of insurgent attacks and a heavily militarised border. \"It\\'s a huge, huge undertaking to set up a humanitarian operation\\xa0from\\xa0scratch,\" said one aid official who asked not to be named. \"We\\'re not set up like that, not even close, from the\\xa0Egyptian\\xa0side.\"BottlenecksThe aid operation was brokered in talks involving the United States, Israel and Egypt, with a deal to start with a convoy of 20 trucks clinched during a visit by US President Joe Biden to Israel last week, aid officials and diplomats say.As it began, details of an inspection system were still being worked out.Scaling up aid required a quick and light system based on random checks, such as that used for sending aid from Turkey into north-western Syria, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said.Trucks are currently driving more than 40km south along the Egypt-Israel border to be inspected before returning to Gaza.This means a lag of several hours between their entry into the crossing on the Egyptian side and their exit into Gaza. \"There are bottlenecks,\" said Ms Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, which brought some supplies into Gaza with the first convoys but has many more waiting on the Egyptian side of the border.\"What exactly are these bottlenecks? It\\'s very unclear, but I think a lot of it is basically, probably the inspection mechanism and the ability of movement inside Gaza,\" she said.Some Gaza bakeries the WFP works with have been put out of operation because of shortages of fuel, a commodity that has so far not been allowed to cross because of Israeli concerns that it could be used by Hamas.Fuel is also crucial for hospital generators and water supplies, and is fast running out.    US Special Envoy David Satterfield, who has been negotiating with Israel, Egypt and the UN to set up sustained aid deliveries, told MSNBC on Oct 22 that while the critical role of fuel was understood, the provision of food, water and medicine would continue to be the focus \"in the immediate future\".Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.BattlefieldThe US, along with other countries, has also been negotiating to get thousands of foreign passport holders out of Gaza through Rafah.Qatar has meanwhile been leading efforts for the release of hostages taken by Hamas militants during the Oct 7 attack.Two Egyptian security sources linked scaling up of aid to Hamas\\'s willingness to free hostages. From a total of more than 200 hostages, two were freed through Rafah late on Monday, with Hamas crediting Qatar and Egypt for their mediation. Two others were released last week.  The UN says delivery of aid should be unconditional.  On the Gaza side of the border, distribution will depend on the pattern of the conflict and mass displacement of residents, which could be further complicated by an expected Israeli ground operation. As intense bombardment continues, aid organisations have appealed for a humanitarian pause or ceasefire to deliver relief. Security guarantees, especially for northern Gaza where Israeli bombing is concentrated, had not been forthcoming, said Mr Rick Brennan, emergencies director for the World Health Organization. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says 35 of its staff have been killed in Gaza since Oct 7.Bombardment has damaged roads and buildings around Rafah. Not long after Sunday\\'s convoy of trucks entered the crossing, shelling from an Israeli tank hit an Egyptian position nearby, wounding several Egyptian border guards. Israel said the incident was an accident.\"We\\'re going to have to adapt the whole logistics of the operation according to what is transpiring on the battlefield,\" said Mr Griffiths. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Israel PM Netanyahu rejects Gaza ceasefire, says it amounts to ‘surrendering to Hamas’',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday a ceasefire in the Israel’s war against Hamas “will not happen”, as the United Nations warned not enough aid was coming in to meet “unprecedented humanitarian needs”.Israeli ground forces fought inside the Gaza Strip and air strikes pounded the besieged Hamas-run Palestinian territory in response to the Oct 7 attack – the deadliest in Israel’s history.The intensifying military operations have sharply heightened fears for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza, where the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says more than 8,300 have been killed.In a briefing to foreign press, Mr Netanyahu said a ceasefire would amount to surrendering to Hamas, whose gunmen killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages, according to the latest Israeli figures.“Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen,” he said, vowing Israel will “fight until this battle is won”.The United States, Israel’s ally, also objected to a ceasefire.“We do not believe that a ceasefire is the right answer right now,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, adding that “pauses” to get aid into Gaza should be considered instead.As Israeli forces battled Hamas militants inside the narrow Palestinian territory and sent tanks to the outskirts of Gaza City, concern has surged about the widening humanitarian crisis.Mr Kirby said Washington was “confident” of increasing the number of aid trucks to Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt to around 100 a day.Limited aid has entered Gaza from Egypt under a US-brokered deal, but its volume has fallen far short of the hundreds of trucks a day aid agencies say are needed.Mr Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, called for the Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs,” he said.Israeli tanks on Gaza highway The Hamas attack set off the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, marked by weeks of withering aerial bombardment and three continuous nights of ground operations centred on northern Gaza, which Israel has told civilians to evacuate.Columns of Israeli tanks and armoured bulldozers were seen churning through the sand, and snipers took positions inside emptied residential buildings, in footage released by the army.Dozens of tanks advanced for more than an hour into the southern fringes of Gaza City and blocked the main north-south highway, “firing at any vehicle that tries to go on it”, an eyewitness told AFP by phone.Air strikes also cratered the road and brought down buildings, residents said, before the tanks withdrew.The Israeli ground forces were supported by heavy fire from the air and artillery, with the army striking more than 600 targets within 24 hours, up from 450 reported by the military a day earlier.Hamas said it had fired anti-tank missiles at two Israeli armoured vehicles and that “blows delivered by the resistance have prevented” Israeli troops from establishing a presence in Gaza.The Israeli military also said a woman soldier was rescued from captivity after an operation in the Hamas-run territory. The release of Ms Ori Megidish was “secured during a ground operation”, the army said, adding that she had been “medically checked” and was “doing well”.Mr Netanyahu said the international community must demand the captives remaining in Gaza “be freed immediately, unconditionally”.Hamas released a video of what it said were three women hostages, seated against a tile wall, although the time and place of the recording could not be verified.One called in an agitated tone for Mr Netanyahu to agree to Hamas’ proposed exchange of the hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Mr Netanyahu decried the clip as “cruel psychological propaganda”.‘Bombing followed us’ The more than 230 hostages – aged between a few months and above 80 – are believed to be held in a network of underground tunnels where Hamas has hid its military infrastructure from Israeli surveillance and air attacks.Israel confirmed the death of one of those missing – German-Israeli Shani Louk, 23, who was captured by Hamas when its gunmen stormed a desert music festival.Fear and desperation have spiralled in Gaza, under weeks of siege that have cut off water, food, fuel and other essentials.Internet access was severed on Friday but restored on Sunday following US pressure, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.“We made clear to the government of Israel over the weekend that communications networks needed to be restored,” he said on Monday. “It is about ensuring that vital information flows, humanitarian coordination continues and families can stay in touch.”The UN reported on Sunday that “thousands of people” had ransacked aid warehouses in Gaza.Donkey carts were lining up to load water, as safe drinking water has become scarce in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.According to the UN, all 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders – despite sheltering thousands of patients and about 117,000 displaced people.“We were displaced from our homes to the hospital,” Gaza City resident Ashraf al-Muzani, 38, said from Al-Quds hospital where he and his family have sheltered for a week. “The bombing followed us,” he added. “We haven’t been able to sleep and our children are so frightened.”‘Highest’ UN death toll Mr Lazzarini said 64 of his colleagues had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, “the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict in such a short time”.Anti-Israel anger has flared across the region and beyond.In Russia’s Muslim-majority Dagestan, police said they had arrested 60 people after a crowd stormed an airport on Sunday to attack passengers arriving from Tel Aviv.And Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the US of being responsible for what he called “deadly chaos” unfolding in the Middle East.Washington has warned Israel’s enemies – in particular Iran-allied groups – not to become more fully involved after a series of attacks across the region. Israel’s military has struck targets in Syria and traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told AFP he was “doing my duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war”.Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank where health officials say about 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire and in settler attacks since the Gaza war started.

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – As part of efforts to help the victims of the conflict in Gaza, the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) will be sending US$200,000 (S$273,000) worth of relief supplies to the war zone.The SRC said on Tuesday that the relief supplies will include items such as hygiene kits, clean water, food provisions, and medical consumables and equipment such as wheelchairs.The SRC has also deployed a staff member to Cairo, Egypt, to work with the Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC) in identifying immediate and critical needs in Gaza, and to facilitate the delivery of relief supplies in the coming days.The SRC and ERC are working closely to coordinate humanitarian aid into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing – the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.They are also scaling up efforts to provide more humanitarian assistance, the SRC said.Food, water and medical supplies have been coming through the Egyptian border, but the provided aid is simply too small to meet the huge needs on the ground, according to reports.Affected communities in the Gaza Strip have received limited humanitarian aid, said the SRC statement, adding that the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has been working under “challenging conditions” to deliver emergency assistance such as ambulance and healthcare services.“There are severe shortages of essential necessities such as fuel, water and food, while medical supplies are depleting rapidly,” said the SRC.“While some humanitarian aid has arrived in Gaza with support from the ERC and PRCS, it remains inadequate to meet the extensive needs.”SRC chief executive Benjamin William said: “We are deeply concerned about the suffering and anguish experienced by the people in Gaza. Families, children, women and the elderly are enduring unimaginable hardships.”Many victims have to walk long distances to reach safe areas and have no access to basic necessities such as shelter and water, he said.He added that damaged infrastructure and a “communication paralysis” have exacerbated the crisis, leaving victims disconnected from the outside world.“We continue to urge all parties involved to uphold their responsibilities as outlined in international humanitarian law, and prioritise the protection of civilians,” said Mr William, adding that it is important for hospitals, doctors, nurses and humanitarian workers to be protected as well.“It is essential that all parties recognise and enable unhindered critical humanitarian aid into Gaza for all the affected communities, including those who have been displaced.” Two weeks ago, the SRC launched a public fund-raising appeal for relief and recovery operations, which will close on Jan 31, 2024.The organisation earlier pledged US$150,000 to relief efforts, while the Singapore Government contributed $300,000 towards relief operations through the SRC.Members of the public who wish to make an online donation can visit redcross.sg/gazaresponse',\n",

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Singapore has expressed its support for the efforts of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to sustain the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and calls for all innocent civilian lives to be protected, said Singapore’s Ambassador to the UN Burhan Gafoor.“At the outset, I wish to express Singapore’s utmost support for the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to sustain the flow of humanitarian assistance to the civilians affected by this terrible tragedy in Gaza,” said Mr Gafoor.“We commend the Secretary-General for his leadership role in facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance and recognise the important contributions made by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations on the ground,” he noted.He added that Singapore supports all efforts to defuse tensions in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict.“Respect for the UN Charter and for international law has always been a fundamental guiding principle of Singapore’s foreign policy. The UN Charter and international law provide the foundation for international peace and security,” Mr Gafoor said.The ambassador made these comments at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, as Singapore voted in support of a resolution drafted by Arab states calling for an immediate humanitarian truce.The non-binding resolution received 121 votes in favour, while 44 abstained and 14 – including Israel and the United States – voted “no”. Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s retaliatory action has killed more than 7,000 people in Gaza, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry. Mr Gafoor said: “We mourn the loss and suffering of so many innocent civilians, including children and the elderly. This attack (by Hamas) cannot be condoned or justified by any rationale. We condemn this terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms. We also call for the immediate and safe release of all hostages taken by Hamas.“In this regard, it is worth recalling that just in June this year, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,” he noted. This, he said, calls for the international community to reiterate its “strong and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes”.Israel has the legitimate right to defend its citizens and its territory under international law, said Mr Gafoor.However, he also pointed out that Israel also has an obligation to comply with international humanitarian law.\\xa0“All parties must abide by international humanitarian law and do their utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians,” said the ambassador.He added that Singapore welcomes all efforts to establish and uphold safe zones and routes that will keep civilians out of harm’s way and allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. “Singapore is deeply saddened by the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the loss of so many civilian lives. This is a massive humanitarian crisis,” said Mr Gafoor.“We urge all parties involved to allow the rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and essential services to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” he added. To support humanitarian relief operations in Gaza, the Government has made a financial contribution through the Singapore Red Cross, said Mr Gafoor. Many Singaporeans have also made their own contributions to relief operations, he said, noting that it is the Republic’s hope that their contributions will reach those in need quickly. On the resolution, Mr Gafoor said that Singapore has voted in favour after very careful consideration, but added that the Republic deeply regrets that this resolution has “two glaring and significant omissions”. “First, it makes no mention of Hamas’ role in perpetrating the massive and coordinated terror attacks, which led to the brutal killing of 1,400 Israelis and others and the abduction of more than 200 hostages,” he said.“These are acts of terror that we condemn unequivocally, and the abhorrent deeds of Hamas cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever,” said the ambassador, as he reiterated Singapore’s call for the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all civilians taken hostage. “Second, this resolution\\xa0does not acknowledge Israel’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory in compliance with international law. As with every country, Israel has a right to defend itself from heinous terrorist attacks, to protect its people from senseless violence and to keep its territory secure,” he added.Nevertheless, Singapore supported the resolution as the Republic has “always been a consistent advocate and defender of international law, the UN Charter and the rules-based multilateral system”, said Mr Gafoor.\\xa0\\xa0He pointed out that the resolution reaffirms all parties’ obligations to respect and uphold international law, including international humanitarian law. “It expresses strong support for the efforts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and for his calls for the immediate and unrestricted access of humanitarian aid, and to respond to the most basic needs of the Palestinian civilian population amidst the unfolding humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip,” said Mr Gafoor.The resolution, he said, demands that all parties immediately and fully comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law.\\xa0“These obligations have been spelt out in many UN Security Council resolutions. All innocent civilian lives must be protected,” he stressed.On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr Gafoor said that it is a “longstanding one, and it must be resolved in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. He called it the only way to stop the repeated cycles of violence. “Singapore’s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been consistent. We continue to hold the view that the only viable path to a durable, just and comprehensive solution is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” he said. Mr Gafoor also stressed that Singapore calls on leaders from both sides to show leadership, to exercise restraint and to take the difficult but necessary steps towards the vision of a two-state solution.“We support the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland, and Israel’s right to live within secure borders. Both Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, security and dignity,” he added.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Aid supplies to Gaza halted again, UN says starvation imminent   ',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM – United Nations aid deliveries to Gaza were suspended again on Nov 17 due to shortages of fuel and a communications shutdown, deepening the misery of thousands of hungry and homeless Palestinians as Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the enclave. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said civilians faced the “immediate possibility of starvation” due to the lack of food supplies. Palestinian news agency Wafa said a number of Palestinians were killed and others injured in an Israeli strike that hit a group of displaced people near the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt – the transit point for aid. Al Jazeera TV cited sources as saying that nine people were killed in the strike. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the reported strike, and Reuters could not verify it.In other developments, Israel said its troops had found a tunnel shaft used by Hamas at Al-Shifa Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip.The hospital, packed with patients and displaced people and struggling to keep operating, has been a major focus of global concern this week. Israel says Hamas has stored weapons and ammunition and is holding hostages in a network of tunnels under hospitals like Shifa, using patients and people taking shelter there as human shields. Hamas denies this.With the war about to enter its seventh week, there is no sign of any let-up despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.The conflict was triggered by a cross-border raid by Hamas militants on Oct 7 that killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, in the deadliest day in the state’s 75-year-history.More than 11,500 Palestinians, at least 4,700 of them children, have now been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military assault on Hamas-ruled Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry – a toll that far surpasses previous bouts of conflict in recent years.Israel has vowed to wipe out the militant group. Whole neighbourhoods of Gaza have been flattened in air and artillery strikes, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, and the humanitarian situation is catastrophic, aid agencies say.Trucks suspendedThe UN said there would be no cross-border aid operation on Nov 17 due to fuel shortages and a communication shutdown.  For a second consecutive day on Nov 16, no aid lorries arrived in Gaza due to lack of fuel for distributing relief.WFP executive director Cindy McCain said nearly the entire population was in desperate need of food assistance.“Supplies of food and water are practically non-existent in Gaza and only a fraction of what is needed is arriving through the borders,” she said in a statement.“With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,” Ms McCain said.A UN human rights official said Israel must allow water and fuel into Gaza to restart the water supply network.“Every hour that passes with Israel preventing the provision of safe drinking water in the Gaza Strip, in brazen breach of international law, puts Gazans at risk of dying of thirst and diseases,” Mr Pedro Arrojo-Agudo said.The World Health Organisation on Nov 17 said it was very worried about the spread of disease in Gaza, citing more than 70,000 reported cases of acute respiratory infections and over 44,000 cases of diarrhoea, far more than expected.The Israeli military’s chief of staff said Israel was close to destroying Hamas’ military system in the northern Gaza Strip, and there were signs the army was taking its campaign to other parts of the coastal enclave of 2.3 million people.Israel accused Hamas of preventing people from heading to the south of the Gaza Strip, which the militant group denied.The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of Al-Shifa, Gaza’s biggest hospital.The video, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a deep hole in the ground, littered with and surrounded by concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.The army said its troops also found a vehicle in the hospital containing a large number of weapons.Reuters journalists have been unable to reach anyone inside Al-Shifa Hospital for more than 24 hours.Hamas on Nov 16 said claims by the United States that the group uses Shifa for military purposes were “a repetition of a blatantly false narrative, demonstrated by the weak and ridiculous performances of the occupation army spokesman”. Israeli officials said Hamas held some of the 240 hostages taken by gunmen on Oct 7 in the hospital complex.On Nov 17 the Israeli military said soldiers retrieved the body of a female soldier who had been held captive in a building near Shifa.The military confirmed her death on Nov 14 after Hamas issued a video of her alive, followed by images of what it said was her body after she was killed in an Israeli strike.On Nov 16, troops recovered the body of another woman hostage, also in a building near Shifa.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Hamas’ Al-Quds Brigades said they had engaged Israeli forces for several hours in the city of Jenin overnight into Nov 17, unleashing a “torrent of fire” and laying ambushes with explosives.Israel’s military said warplanes struck militants in Jenin who had opened fire on Israeli soldiers. It said at least five of the militants were killed.At least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the Oct 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The violence there has underscored fears that the territory, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, could spiral out of control in tandem with the conflict in Gaza. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'GENEVA – \\xa0The United Nations’ high commissioner for human rights on Tuesday condemned allegations of mass killings and executions by Palestinian armed groups, as he warned that Israel’s announcement of a “complete siege” of Gaza would exacerbate the “already dire” humanitarian situation in the coast.“All parties must respect international humanitarian law,” Mr Volker Turk said in a statement. “They must immediately cease attacks targeting civilians and attacks expected to cause disproportionate death and injury of civilians or damage to civilian objects.”As Israeli warplanes struck hundreds of sites on Monday, Israel’s defence minister said “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed into Gaza, which is controlled by the militant group Hamas and is under a 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt that heavily restricts access for people and goods. Mr Turk said the ability of medical facilities to treat the growing number of people wounded in Israeli strikes would be harmed by a “full siege”.  “The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,” he said. He added that restrictions on people and goods must be “justified by military necessity” or may amount to collective punishment.The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza warned on Sunday of large shortages of medicine and health equipment, as well as fuel required to keep hospital electrical generators running.Mr Turk also said he was “deeply shocked and appalled by allegations of summary executions of civilians, and, in some instances, horrifying mass killings by members of Palestinian armed groups”. He called on Palestinian armed factions to immediately release Israeli civilians who were taken hostage. About 150 people are believed to have been abducted by Palestinian gunmen in the attacks that began on Saturday.“It is horrific and deeply distressing to see images of those captured by Palestinian armed groups being ill-treated, as well as reports of killings and the desecration of their bodies,” he said. “Civilians must never be used as bargaining chips.”The World Health Organisation (WHO) called on Tuesday for a humanitarian corridor to be established into and out of the Gaza.The WHO had reported 13 attacks on health facilities in Gaza since the weekend, and that the organisation’s medical supplies stored there had already been used up.\\xa0“WHO is calling for an end to the violence… A humanitarian corridor is needed to reach people with critical medical supplies,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told journalists in Geneva.“We need supplies to come in: hospitals cannot run without fuel, without electricity.“The supplies that we have pre-positioned are already running low so we need those supplies to come,” Mr Jasarevic said.The United Nations humanitarian office said nearly 200,000 people, or nearly a tenth of the population, have fled their homes in Gaza since the start of hostilities.

       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON - Israel\\'s war Cabinet has agreed to allow 140,000 litres of fuel into Gaza every two days, after a request from Washington, amid acute shortages that threatened aid deliveries and communications in the besieged strip, Israel and US officials said on Friday.Israel imposed a strict blockade on all goods entering Hamas-controlled Gaza when it launched a military campaign in response to the Palestinian militant group\\'s Oct 7 rampage, in which they killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages.Israel has since agreed to allow in aid trucks after stringent inspections, and a small amount of fuel was allowed in on Wednesday to keep United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) aid delivery trucks moving.An Israeli official who declined to be identified said two trucks a day would be allowed in to meet the UN\\'s needs, but said the amount would give \"minimal\" support for water, sewage and sanitary systems in Gaza to prevent pandemics.A US State Department official, offering more details, said Israel had committed to allowing in 120,000 litres of fuel every 48 hours for UNRWA\\'s trucks and other needs like desalinisation of water, sewage pumping, bakeries and hospitals in the south of Gaza.An additional 20,000 litres every two days would be allowed in to power generators of telecoms company Paltel, which had warned of an imminent blackout of its cellphone network due to lack of fuel. US officials have been pushing Israel to allow fuel in for some time. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken made calls to members of Israel\\'s war Cabinet on Wednesday, and warned that the fuel shortage risked a humanitarian catastrophe among Gaza\\'s 2.3 million residents, the State Department official said. Israeli officials had previously argued that Hamas should release hostages before it eased the pressure on Gaza, the official said, adding that negotiations on the release of hostages continue separate from the move on fuel.    The Israeli official confirmed the decision came after a request from Washington, and said allowing the fuel in gives Israel extra room to maneuver in the international arena so it can continue its campaign to eradicate Hamas in Gaza.

       "  'Text': 'NEW YORK – Palestinian Americans and aid groups in the United States are raising funds for Gaza, which faces a deepening humanitarian crisis as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth week – but they have as yet limited ability to get supplies into the besieged enclave.Aid organisations that serve civilians in Gaza say they are receiving record amounts of donations in a sign of public support for relief efforts, even as a growing stock of supplies remains stalled at Egypt’s Rafah border crossing.In the Gaza Strip, where 2.3 million people live, civilians are in dire need of clean water, food and medicine, emergency medics say. Half of Gaza’s population was already living in poverty before the crisis.“We’ve seen a significant increase in donations, unlike (anything) we’ve ever seen before,” said Mr Steve Sosebee, president of the US-based Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which has a staff headcount of 40 in Gaza, who provide medical support.He said the fund, which usually has an annual budget of around US$12 million (S$16.45 million), had raised US$15 million in just 10 days.However, with a web of political and logistical obstacles on getting aid in, much of the money and supplies intended for Gaza is in limbo, forcing aid groups to wait as they amass truckloads of goods.Hamas militants burst over the Gaza border and rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people and taking 229 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.In response, Israel launched its most intense air bombardment campaign on the tiny enclave, along with a “total siege”, banning food, water and fuel imports.Aid groups say they are building up supplies in hopes of eventually getting them through to civilians in Gaza, nearly half of whom are children.There has been “a five-fold increase in the total number of donors versus typical past emergencies”, said Mr Derek Madsen, chief development\\xa0officer of Anera, a non-partisan emergency relief group for refugees throughout the Middle East.The organisation, which maintains the privacy of individual donors, said it had recently received the largest single donation from an individual in its 55-year history.The majority of support comes from donors based in the US, he added, with individual donations averaging around US$138. The efforts mirror those of Jewish groups in the US and Canada, who also fundraised millions for Israel.Anera was using the last of its stocks this week to distribute meals and vegetable parcels in Gaza. Its staff of 12, like everyone in Gaza, were facing “unbelievable, unimaginable trauma”, he said.Glued to the televisionIn Ann Arbor, Michigan, Ms Rabia Shafie, national director of the Palestine Aid Society, said her group was speaking to student and Muslim groups on local university campuses and community centres to spread awareness and raise donations for the Red Crescent and UNRWA, the United Nations aid agency that serves Palestinian refugees.“The money is needed to help people survive at this point of time. Medical support is so essential,” she said.“People are glued to the television... watching the news moment to moment, and very stressed out over the situation,” said Ms Rabia, adding that it was difficult as a Palestinian American to watch “the massacre and injustice done to our people back home”.Hamas-governed Gaza is one of the most densely packed places on Earth, and its medical authorities say over 8,000 Palestinians have been killed since air strikes began, including more than 3,000 children.Mr Madsen called for a ceasefire and establishment of a humanitarian corridor “so that people literally do not starve to death, literally do not die of dehydration”.Last week, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, home to one of New York’s largest Muslim and Arab communities, hundreds of protesters called for a ceasefire with signs written in Arabic, Spanish, Hebrew and Korean.In Clifton, New Jersey, the Palestinian American Community Centre’s priorities are calling for US officials to support a ceasefire, and the hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza, said Ms Basma Bsharat, the education director of the centre.The centre has also been collecting cash donations to send on to UNRWA. It has asked people not to donate supplies, which it has no easy way of sending to those in need in Gaza.Last week, a woman came to the centre anyway, hauling bags filled with goods.  “We didn’t know how to say no,” said Ms Basma. “She was like, I just want to do something. I just want to help somehow.”“It’s a very difficult time, and the fact that we do see the support coming in it, it gives some relief,” she said. “It gives some kind of solace.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The nightmare of delivering aid during this Israel-Hamas war',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The 2.3 million people who live in Gaza are facing economic isolation and experiencing incessant bombardment. Their supplies of essential resources, including food and water, are quickly dwindling.In response, US President Joe Biden has pledged US$100 million (S$136 million) in humanitarian assistance for the citizens of Gaza.Mr Biden’s promise raises fundamental questions regarding the delivery of humanitarian aid in a war zone. Political constraints, ethical quandaries and the need to protect the security of aid workers and local communities always make the effort a logistical nightmare.In this specific predicament, US officials have to choose a strategy to deliver the aid without the perception of benefiting Hamas, a group the US and Israel both classify as a terrorist organisation.LogisticsWhen aiding people in war zones, you can’t just send money, a development strategy called “cash transfers” that has become increasingly popular due to its efficiency. Sending money can boost the supply of locally produced goods and services, and help people on the ground pay for what they need most. But injecting cash into an economy so completely cut off from the world would only stoke inflation.So the aid must consist of goods that have to be brought into Gaza, and services provided by people working as part of an aid mission. Humanitarian aid can include food and water; health, sanitation and hygiene supplies and services; and tents and other materials for shelter and settlement.Due to the closure of the border with Israel, aid can arrive in Gaza only via the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border.The US Agency for International Development, or USAid, will likely turn to its long-time partner on the ground, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, to serve as supply depots and distribute goods. That agency, originally founded in 1949 as a temporary measure until a two-state solution could be found, serves in effect as a parallel yet unelected government for Palestinian refugees.USAid will likely want to tap into UNRWA’s network of 284 schools – many of which are now transformed into humanitarian shelters housing two-thirds of the estimated one million people displaced by Israeli air strikes – and 22 hospitals to expedite distribution.PoliticsPrior to the Trump administration, the US was typically the largest single provider of aid to the West Bank and Gaza. USAid administers the lion’s share of it.Since Mr Biden took office, total yearly US assistance for the Palestinian territories has totalled around US$150 million, restored from just US$8 million in 2020 under the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, however, the US was providing more aid to the territories than it is now, with US$1 billion disbursed in the 2013 fiscal year.But the White House needs Congress to approve this assistance – a process that requires the House of Representatives to elect a new Speaker and then for lawmakers to approve aid to Gaza once that happens.EthicsThe UNRWA is a UN organisation. It is not run by Hamas, unlike, for instance, the Gaza Ministry of Health. However, Hamas has frequently undermined UNRWA’s efforts and diverted international aid for military purposes.  Hamas has repeatedly used UNRWA schools as rocket depots. It has repeatedly tunnelled beneath UNRWA schools. It has dismantled European Union-funded water pipes to use as rocket fuselages. And even since the most recent violence broke out, the UNRWA has accused Hamas of stealing fuel and food from its Gaza premises.Humanitarian aid professionals regularly have to contend with these trade-offs when deciding to what extent they can work with governments and local authorities that commit violent acts. They need to do so in exchange for the access required to help civilians under their control.Similarly, Mr Biden has had to make concessions to Israel while brokering for the freedom to send humanitarian aid to Gaza. For example, he has assured Israel that if any of the aid is diverted by Hamas, the operation will cease.This promise may have been politically necessary. But if Mr Biden already believes Hamas to be uncaring about civilian welfare, he may not expect the group to refrain from taking what it can.Security best practicesWhat can be done to protect the security of humanitarian aid operations that take place in the midst of dangerous conflicts?Under international humanitarian law, the local authorities have the primary responsibility for ensuring the delivery of aid – even when they aren’t carrying out that task. To increase the chances that the local authorities will not attack them, aid groups can give “humanitarian notification” and voluntarily alert the local government as to where they will be operating.Hamas has repeatedly flouted international norms and laws. So the question of if and how the aid convoy will be protected looms large.Under the current agreement between the US, Israel and Egypt, the convoy will raise the UN flag. International inspectors will make sure no weapons are on board the vehicles before they cross over from Arish, Egypt, to Rafah, a city located on the Gaza Strip’s border with Egypt.The aid convoy will likely cross without militarised security. This puts it at some danger of diversion once inside Gaza. But whether the aid convoy is attacked, seized or left alone, the Biden administration will have demonstrated its willingness to attempt a humanitarian relief operation. In this sense, a relatively small first convoy bearing water, medical supplies and food, among other items, serves as a test balloon for a sustained operation to follow soon after.If the US were to provide the humanitarian convoy a military escort, by contrast, Hamas could see its presence as a provocation. Washington’s support for Israel is so strong that the US could potentially be judged as a party in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.In that case, the presence of US armed forces might provoke attacks on Gaza-bound aid convoys by Hamas  fighters that otherwise would not have occurred. Combined with the mobilisation of two US Navy carrier groups in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, I’d be concerned that such a move might also stoke regional anger. It would undermine the Biden administration’s attempts to cool the situation.On UN-approved missions, aid delivery may be secured by third-party peacekeepers – meaning, in this case, personnel who are neither Israeli nor Palestinian – with the UN Security Council’s blessing. In this case, tragically, it is unlikely that such a resolution could conceivably pass such a vote, much less quickly enough to make a difference.Topher L.

       "  'Text': 'CAIRO - With a trickle of aid flowing into the besieged Gaza Strip from Egypt, humanitarian staff and diplomats face a web of political, security and logistical obstacles as they try to build up and sustain deliveries of relief.The aid is desperately needed. Supplies of food, water, medicines and fuel have been running critically low for Gaza\\'s 2.3 million people since Israel began its bombardment and \"total siege\" of the Palestinian enclave.Israel’s action is in retaliation for an attack by Hamas militants on Oct 7. But Israel\\'s conditions for inspecting and tracking the aid, security risks transporting and distributing it, and arrangement of its passage through a crossing not used during previous conflicts for large-scale relief efforts have all hampered work to get the operation off the ground.Aid began flowing through Rafah, the main exit and entry point for Gaza that does not border Israel, on Oct 21, with up to 20 trucks crossing daily since. United Nations officials say 100 trucks are required daily to meet essential needs.During past conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, aid had mainly been delivered through crossing points with Israel.The UN aid operation for the Palestinian territories has been run through Israel since the 1950s.Now aid needs to be brought in from Egypt\\'s Sinai Peninsula, an isolated region with a recent history of insurgent attacks and a heavily militarised border. \"It\\'s a huge, huge undertaking to set up a humanitarian operation\\xa0from\\xa0scratch,\" said one aid official who asked not to be named. \"We\\'re not set up like that, not even close, from the\\xa0Egyptian\\xa0side.\"BottlenecksThe aid operation was brokered in talks involving the United States, Israel and Egypt, with a deal to start with a convoy of 20 trucks clinched during a visit by US President Joe Biden to Israel last week, aid officials and diplomats say.As it began, details of an inspection system were still being worked out.Scaling up aid required a quick and light system based on random checks, such as that used for sending aid from Turkey into north-western Syria, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said.Trucks are currently driving more than 40km south along the Egypt-Israel border to be inspected before returning to Gaza.This means a lag of several hours between their entry into the crossing on the Egyptian side and their exit into Gaza. \"There are bottlenecks,\" said Ms Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, which brought some supplies into Gaza with the first convoys but has many more waiting on the Egyptian side of the border.\"What exactly are these bottlenecks? It\\'s very unclear, but I think a lot of it is basically, probably the inspection mechanism and the ability of movement inside Gaza,\" she said.Some Gaza bakeries the WFP works with have been put out of operation because of shortages of fuel, a commodity that has so far not been allowed to cross because of Israeli concerns that it could be used by Hamas.Fuel is also crucial for hospital generators and water supplies, and is fast running out.    US Special Envoy David Satterfield, who has been negotiating with Israel, Egypt and the UN to set up sustained aid deliveries, told MSNBC on Oct 22 that while the critical role of fuel was understood, the provision of food, water and medicine would continue to be the focus \"in the immediate future\".Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.BattlefieldThe US, along with other countries, has also been negotiating to get thousands of foreign passport holders out of Gaza through Rafah.Qatar has meanwhile been leading efforts for the release of hostages taken by Hamas militants during the Oct 7 attack.Two Egyptian security sources linked scaling up of aid to Hamas\\'s willingness to free hostages. From a total of more than 200 hostages, two were freed through Rafah late on Monday, with Hamas crediting Qatar and Egypt for their mediation. Two others were released last week.  The UN says delivery of aid should be unconditional.  On the Gaza side of the border, distribution will depend on the pattern of the conflict and mass displacement of residents, which could be further complicated by an expected Israeli ground operation. As intense bombardment continues, aid organisations have appealed for a humanitarian pause or ceasefire to deliver relief. Security guarantees, especially for northern Gaza where Israeli bombing is concentrated, had not been forthcoming, said Mr Rick Brennan, emergencies director for the World Health Organization. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says 35 of its staff have been killed in Gaza since Oct 7.Bombardment has damaged roads and buildings around Rafah. Not long after Sunday\\'s convoy of trucks entered the crossing, shelling from an Israeli tank hit an Egyptian position nearby, wounding several Egyptian border guards. Israel said the incident was an accident.\"We\\'re going to have to adapt the whole logistics of the operation according to what is transpiring on the battlefield,\" said Mr Griffiths. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Israel PM Netanyahu rejects Gaza ceasefire, says it amounts to ‘surrendering to Hamas’',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday a ceasefire in the Israel’s war against Hamas “will not happen”, as the United Nations warned not enough aid was coming in to meet “unprecedented humanitarian needs”.Israeli ground forces fought inside the Gaza Strip and air strikes pounded the besieged Hamas-run Palestinian territory in response to the Oct 7 attack – the deadliest in Israel’s history.The intensifying military operations have sharply heightened fears for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza, where the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says more than 8,300 have been killed.In a briefing to foreign press, Mr Netanyahu said a ceasefire would amount to surrendering to Hamas, whose gunmen killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages, according to the latest Israeli figures.“Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen,” he said, vowing Israel will “fight until this battle is won”.The United States, Israel’s ally, also objected to a ceasefire.“We do not believe that a ceasefire is the right answer right now,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, adding that “pauses” to get aid into Gaza should be considered instead.As Israeli forces battled Hamas militants inside the narrow Palestinian territory and sent tanks to the outskirts of Gaza City, concern has surged about the widening humanitarian crisis.Mr Kirby said Washington was “confident” of increasing the number of aid trucks to Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt to around 100 a day.Limited aid has entered Gaza from Egypt under a US-brokered deal, but its volume has fallen far short of the hundreds of trucks a day aid agencies say are needed.Mr Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, called for the Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs,” he said.Israeli tanks on Gaza highway The Hamas attack set off the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, marked by weeks of withering aerial bombardment and three continuous nights of ground operations centred on northern Gaza, which Israel has told civilians to evacuate.Columns of Israeli tanks and armoured bulldozers were seen churning through the sand, and snipers took positions inside emptied residential buildings, in footage released by the army.Dozens of tanks advanced for more than an hour into the southern fringes of Gaza City and blocked the main north-south highway, “firing at any vehicle that tries to go on it”, an eyewitness told AFP by phone.Air strikes also cratered the road and brought down buildings, residents said, before the tanks withdrew.The Israeli ground forces were supported by heavy fire from the air and artillery, with the army striking more than 600 targets within 24 hours, up from 450 reported by the military a day earlier.Hamas said it had fired anti-tank missiles at two Israeli armoured vehicles and that “blows delivered by the resistance have prevented” Israeli troops from establishing a presence in Gaza.The Israeli military also said a woman soldier was rescued from captivity after an operation in the Hamas-run territory. The release of Ms Ori Megidish was “secured during a ground operation”, the army said, adding that she had been “medically checked” and was “doing well”.Mr Netanyahu said the international community must demand the captives remaining in Gaza “be freed immediately, unconditionally”.Hamas released a video of what it said were three women hostages, seated against a tile wall, although the time and place of the recording could not be verified.One called in an agitated tone for Mr Netanyahu to agree to Hamas’ proposed exchange of the hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Mr Netanyahu decried the clip as “cruel psychological propaganda”.‘Bombing followed us’ The more than 230 hostages – aged between a few months and above 80 – are believed to be held in a network of underground tunnels where Hamas has hid its military infrastructure from Israeli surveillance and air attacks.Israel confirmed the death of one of those missing – German-Israeli Shani Louk, 23, who was captured by Hamas when its gunmen stormed a desert music festival.Fear and desperation have spiralled in Gaza, under weeks of siege that have cut off water, food, fuel and other essentials.Internet access was severed on Friday but restored on Sunday following US pressure, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.“We made clear to the government of Israel over the weekend that communications networks needed to be restored,” he said on Monday. “It is about ensuring that vital information flows, humanitarian coordination continues and families can stay in touch.”The UN reported on Sunday that “thousands of people” had ransacked aid warehouses in Gaza.Donkey carts were lining up to load water, as safe drinking water has become scarce in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.According to the UN, all 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders – despite sheltering thousands of patients and about 117,000 displaced people.“We were displaced from our homes to the hospital,” Gaza City resident Ashraf al-Muzani, 38, said from Al-Quds hospital where he and his family have sheltered for a week. “The bombing followed us,” he added. “We haven’t been able to sleep and our children are so frightened.”‘Highest’ UN death toll Mr Lazzarini said 64 of his colleagues had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, “the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict in such a short time”.Anti-Israel anger has flared across the region and beyond.In Russia’s Muslim-majority Dagestan, police said they had arrested 60 people after a crowd stormed an airport on Sunday to attack passengers arriving from Tel Aviv.And Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the US of being responsible for what he called “deadly chaos” unfolding in the Middle East.Washington has warned Israel’s enemies – in particular Iran-allied groups – not to become more fully involved after a series of attacks across the region. Israel’s military has struck targets in Syria and traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told AFP he was “doing my duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war”.Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank where health officials say about 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire and in settler attacks since the Gaza war started.

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – As part of efforts to help the victims of the conflict in Gaza, the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) will be sending US$200,000 (S$273,000) worth of relief supplies to the war zone.The SRC said on Tuesday that the relief supplies will include items such as hygiene kits, clean water, food provisions, and medical consumables and equipment such as wheelchairs.The SRC has also deployed a staff member to Cairo, Egypt, to work with the Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC) in identifying immediate and critical needs in Gaza, and to facilitate the delivery of relief supplies in the coming days.The SRC and ERC are working closely to coordinate humanitarian aid into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing – the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.They are also scaling up efforts to provide more humanitarian assistance, the SRC said.Food, water and medical supplies have been coming through the Egyptian border, but the provided aid is simply too small to meet the huge needs on the ground, according to reports.Affected communities in the Gaza Strip have received limited humanitarian aid, said the SRC statement, adding that the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has been working under “challenging conditions” to deliver emergency assistance such as ambulance and healthcare services.“There are severe shortages of essential necessities such as fuel, water and food, while medical supplies are depleting rapidly,” said the SRC.“While some humanitarian aid has arrived in Gaza with support from the ERC and PRCS, it remains inadequate to meet the extensive needs.”SRC chief executive Benjamin William said: “We are deeply concerned about the suffering and anguish experienced by the people in Gaza. Families, children, women and the elderly are enduring unimaginable hardships.”Many victims have to walk long distances to reach safe areas and have no access to basic necessities such as shelter and water, he said.He added that damaged infrastructure and a “communication paralysis” have exacerbated the crisis, leaving victims disconnected from the outside world.“We continue to urge all parties involved to uphold their responsibilities as outlined in international humanitarian law, and prioritise the protection of civilians,” said Mr William, adding that it is important for hospitals, doctors, nurses and humanitarian workers to be protected as well.“It is essential that all parties recognise and enable unhindered critical humanitarian aid into Gaza for all the affected communities, including those who have been displaced.” Two weeks ago, the SRC launched a public fund-raising appeal for relief and recovery operations, which will close on Jan 31, 2024.The organisation earlier pledged US$150,000 to relief efforts, while the Singapore Government contributed $300,000 towards relief operations through the SRC.Members of the public who wish to make an online donation can visit redcross.sg/gazaresponse',\n",

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Singapore has expressed its support for the efforts of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to sustain the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and calls for all innocent civilian lives to be protected, said Singapore’s Ambassador to the UN Burhan Gafoor.“At the outset, I wish to express Singapore’s utmost support for the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to sustain the flow of humanitarian assistance to the civilians affected by this terrible tragedy in Gaza,” said Mr Gafoor.“We commend the Secretary-General for his leadership role in facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance and recognise the important contributions made by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations on the ground,” he noted.He added that Singapore supports all efforts to defuse tensions in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict.“Respect for the UN Charter and for international law has always been a fundamental guiding principle of Singapore’s foreign policy. The UN Charter and international law provide the foundation for international peace and security,” Mr Gafoor said.The ambassador made these comments at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, as Singapore voted in support of a resolution drafted by Arab states calling for an immediate humanitarian truce.The non-binding resolution received 121 votes in favour, while 44 abstained and 14 – including Israel and the United States – voted “no”. Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s retaliatory action has killed more than 7,000 people in Gaza, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry. Mr Gafoor said: “We mourn the loss and suffering of so many innocent civilians, including children and the elderly. This attack (by Hamas) cannot be condoned or justified by any rationale. We condemn this terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms. We also call for the immediate and safe release of all hostages taken by Hamas.“In this regard, it is worth recalling that just in June this year, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,” he noted. This, he said, calls for the international community to reiterate its “strong and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes”.Israel has the legitimate right to defend its citizens and its territory under international law, said Mr Gafoor.However, he also pointed out that Israel also has an obligation to comply with international humanitarian law.\\xa0“All parties must abide by international humanitarian law and do their utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians,” said the ambassador.He added that Singapore welcomes all efforts to establish and uphold safe zones and routes that will keep civilians out of harm’s way and allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. “Singapore is deeply saddened by the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the loss of so many civilian lives. This is a massive humanitarian crisis,” said Mr Gafoor.“We urge all parties involved to allow the rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and essential services to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” he added. To support humanitarian relief operations in Gaza, the Government has made a financial contribution through the Singapore Red Cross, said Mr Gafoor. Many Singaporeans have also made their own contributions to relief operations, he said, noting that it is the Republic’s hope that their contributions will reach those in need quickly. On the resolution, Mr Gafoor said that Singapore has voted in favour after very careful consideration, but added that the Republic deeply regrets that this resolution has “two glaring and significant omissions”. “First, it makes no mention of Hamas’ role in perpetrating the massive and coordinated terror attacks, which led to the brutal killing of 1,400 Israelis and others and the abduction of more than 200 hostages,” he said.“These are acts of terror that we condemn unequivocally, and the abhorrent deeds of Hamas cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever,” said the ambassador, as he reiterated Singapore’s call for the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all civilians taken hostage. “Second, this resolution\\xa0does not acknowledge Israel’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory in compliance with international law. As with every country, Israel has a right to defend itself from heinous terrorist attacks, to protect its people from senseless violence and to keep its territory secure,” he added.Nevertheless, Singapore supported the resolution as the Republic has “always been a consistent advocate and defender of international law, the UN Charter and the rules-based multilateral system”, said Mr Gafoor.\\xa0\\xa0He pointed out that the resolution reaffirms all parties’ obligations to respect and uphold international law, including international humanitarian law. “It expresses strong support for the efforts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and for his calls for the immediate and unrestricted access of humanitarian aid, and to respond to the most basic needs of the Palestinian civilian population amidst the unfolding humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip,” said Mr Gafoor.The resolution, he said, demands that all parties immediately and fully comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law.\\xa0“These obligations have been spelt out in many UN Security Council resolutions. All innocent civilian lives must be protected,” he stressed.On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr Gafoor said that it is a “longstanding one, and it must be resolved in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. He called it the only way to stop the repeated cycles of violence. “Singapore’s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been consistent. We continue to hold the view that the only viable path to a durable, just and comprehensive solution is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” he said. Mr Gafoor also stressed that Singapore calls on leaders from both sides to show leadership, to exercise restraint and to take the difficult but necessary steps towards the vision of a two-state solution.“We support the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland, and Israel’s right to live within secure borders. Both Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, security and dignity,” he added.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Aid supplies to Gaza halted again, UN says starvation imminent   ',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM – United Nations aid deliveries to Gaza were suspended again on Nov 17 due to shortages of fuel and a communications shutdown, deepening the misery of thousands of hungry and homeless Palestinians as Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the enclave. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said civilians faced the “immediate possibility of starvation” due to the lack of food supplies. Palestinian news agency Wafa said a number of Palestinians were killed and others injured in an Israeli strike that hit a group of displaced people near the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt – the transit point for aid. Al Jazeera TV cited sources as saying that nine people were killed in the strike. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the reported strike, and Reuters could not verify it.In other developments, Israel said its troops had found a tunnel shaft used by Hamas at Al-Shifa Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip.The hospital, packed with patients and displaced people and struggling to keep operating, has been a major focus of global concern this week. Israel says Hamas has stored weapons and ammunition and is holding hostages in a network of tunnels under hospitals like Shifa, using patients and people taking shelter there as human shields. Hamas denies this.With the war about to enter its seventh week, there is no sign of any let-up despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.The conflict was triggered by a cross-border raid by Hamas militants on Oct 7 that killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, in the deadliest day in the state’s 75-year-history.More than 11,500 Palestinians, at least 4,700 of them children, have now been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military assault on Hamas-ruled Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry – a toll that far surpasses previous bouts of conflict in recent years.Israel has vowed to wipe out the militant group. Whole neighbourhoods of Gaza have been flattened in air and artillery strikes, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, and the humanitarian situation is catastrophic, aid agencies say.Trucks suspendedThe UN said there would be no cross-border aid operation on Nov 17 due to fuel shortages and a communication shutdown.  For a second consecutive day on Nov 16, no aid lorries arrived in Gaza due to lack of fuel for distributing relief.WFP executive director Cindy McCain said nearly the entire population was in desperate need of food assistance.“Supplies of food and water are practically non-existent in Gaza and only a fraction of what is needed is arriving through the borders,” she said in a statement.“With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,” Ms McCain said.A UN human rights official said Israel must allow water and fuel into Gaza to restart the water supply network.“Every hour that passes with Israel preventing the provision of safe drinking water in the Gaza Strip, in brazen breach of international law, puts Gazans at risk of dying of thirst and diseases,” Mr Pedro Arrojo-Agudo said.The World Health Organisation on Nov 17 said it was very worried about the spread of disease in Gaza, citing more than 70,000 reported cases of acute respiratory infections and over 44,000 cases of diarrhoea, far more than expected.The Israeli military’s chief of staff said Israel was close to destroying Hamas’ military system in the northern Gaza Strip, and there were signs the army was taking its campaign to other parts of the coastal enclave of 2.3 million people.Israel accused Hamas of preventing people from heading to the south of the Gaza Strip, which the militant group denied.The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of Al-Shifa, Gaza’s biggest hospital.The video, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a deep hole in the ground, littered with and surrounded by concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.The army said its troops also found a vehicle in the hospital containing a large number of weapons.Reuters journalists have been unable to reach anyone inside Al-Shifa Hospital for more than 24 hours.Hamas on Nov 16 said claims by the United States that the group uses Shifa for military purposes were “a repetition of a blatantly false narrative, demonstrated by the weak and ridiculous performances of the occupation army spokesman”. Israeli officials said Hamas held some of the 240 hostages taken by gunmen on Oct 7 in the hospital complex.On Nov 17 the Israeli military said soldiers retrieved the body of a female soldier who had been held captive in a building near Shifa.The military confirmed her death on Nov 14 after Hamas issued a video of her alive, followed by images of what it said was her body after she was killed in an Israeli strike.On Nov 16, troops recovered the body of another woman hostage, also in a building near Shifa.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Hamas’ Al-Quds Brigades said they had engaged Israeli forces for several hours in the city of Jenin overnight into Nov 17, unleashing a “torrent of fire” and laying ambushes with explosives.Israel’s military said warplanes struck militants in Jenin who had opened fire on Israeli soldiers. It said at least five of the militants were killed.At least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the Oct 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The violence there has underscored fears that the territory, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, could spiral out of control in tandem with the conflict in Gaza. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'GENEVA – \\xa0The United Nations’ high commissioner for human rights on Tuesday condemned allegations of mass killings and executions by Palestinian armed groups, as he warned that Israel’s announcement of a “complete siege” of Gaza would exacerbate the “already dire” humanitarian situation in the coast.“All parties must respect international humanitarian law,” Mr Volker Turk said in a statement. “They must immediately cease attacks targeting civilians and attacks expected to cause disproportionate death and injury of civilians or damage to civilian objects.”As Israeli warplanes struck hundreds of sites on Monday, Israel’s defence minister said “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed into Gaza, which is controlled by the militant group Hamas and is under a 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt that heavily restricts access for people and goods. Mr Turk said the ability of medical facilities to treat the growing number of people wounded in Israeli strikes would be harmed by a “full siege”.  “The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,” he said. He added that restrictions on people and goods must be “justified by military necessity” or may amount to collective punishment.The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza warned on Sunday of large shortages of medicine and health equipment, as well as fuel required to keep hospital electrical generators running.Mr Turk also said he was “deeply shocked and appalled by allegations of summary executions of civilians, and, in some instances, horrifying mass killings by members of Palestinian armed groups”. He called on Palestinian armed factions to immediately release Israeli civilians who were taken hostage. About 150 people are believed to have been abducted by Palestinian gunmen in the attacks that began on Saturday.“It is horrific and deeply distressing to see images of those captured by Palestinian armed groups being ill-treated, as well as reports of killings and the desecration of their bodies,” he said. “Civilians must never be used as bargaining chips.”The World Health Organisation (WHO) called on Tuesday for a humanitarian corridor to be established into and out of the Gaza.The WHO had reported 13 attacks on health facilities in Gaza since the weekend, and that the organisation’s medical supplies stored there had already been used up.\\xa0“WHO is calling for an end to the violence… A humanitarian corridor is needed to reach people with critical medical supplies,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told journalists in Geneva.“We need supplies to come in: hospitals cannot run without fuel, without electricity.“The supplies that we have pre-positioned are already running low so we need those supplies to come,” Mr Jasarevic said.The United Nations humanitarian office said nearly 200,000 people, or nearly a tenth of the population, have fled their homes in Gaza since the start of hostilities.

       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON - Israel\\'s war Cabinet has agreed to allow 140,000 litres of fuel into Gaza every two days, after a request from Washington, amid acute shortages that threatened aid deliveries and communications in the besieged strip, Israel and US officials said on Friday.Israel imposed a strict blockade on all goods entering Hamas-controlled Gaza when it launched a military campaign in response to the Palestinian militant group\\'s Oct 7 rampage, in which they killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages.Israel has since agreed to allow in aid trucks after stringent inspections, and a small amount of fuel was allowed in on Wednesday to keep United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) aid delivery trucks moving.An Israeli official who declined to be identified said two trucks a day would be allowed in to meet the UN\\'s needs, but said the amount would give \"minimal\" support for water, sewage and sanitary systems in Gaza to prevent pandemics.A US State Department official, offering more details, said Israel had committed to allowing in 120,000 litres of fuel every 48 hours for UNRWA\\'s trucks and other needs like desalinisation of water, sewage pumping, bakeries and hospitals in the south of Gaza.An additional 20,000 litres every two days would be allowed in to power generators of telecoms company Paltel, which had warned of an imminent blackout of its cellphone network due to lack of fuel. US officials have been pushing Israel to allow fuel in for some time. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken made calls to members of Israel\\'s war Cabinet on Wednesday, and warned that the fuel shortage risked a humanitarian catastrophe among Gaza\\'s 2.3 million residents, the State Department official said. Israeli officials had previously argued that Hamas should release hostages before it eased the pressure on Gaza, the official said, adding that negotiations on the release of hostages continue separate from the move on fuel.    The Israeli official confirmed the decision came after a request from Washington, and said allowing the fuel in gives Israel extra room to maneuver in the international arena so it can continue its campaign to eradicate Hamas in Gaza.

       "  'Title': 'Palestinian Americans fundraise for Gaza, as aid groups receive record donations',\n",
       "  'Text': 'NEW YORK – Palestinian Americans and aid groups in the United States are raising funds for Gaza, which faces a deepening humanitarian crisis as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth week – but they have as yet limited ability to get supplies into the besieged enclave.Aid organisations that serve civilians in Gaza say they are receiving record amounts of donations in a sign of public support for relief efforts, even as a growing stock of supplies remains stalled at Egypt’s Rafah border crossing.In the Gaza Strip, where 2.3 million people live, civilians are in dire need of clean water, food and medicine, emergency medics say. Half of Gaza’s population was already living in poverty before the crisis.“We’ve seen a significant increase in donations, unlike (anything) we’ve ever seen before,” said Mr Steve Sosebee, president of the US-based Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which has a staff headcount of 40 in Gaza, who provide medical support.He said the fund, which usually has an annual budget of around US$12 million (S$16.45 million), had raised US$15 million in just 10 days.However, with a web of political and logistical obstacles on getting aid in, much of the money and supplies intended for Gaza is in limbo, forcing aid groups to wait as they amass truckloads of goods.Hamas militants burst over the Gaza border and rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people and taking 229 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.In response, Israel launched its most intense air bombardment campaign on the tiny enclave, along with a “total siege”, banning food, water and fuel imports.Aid groups say they are building up supplies in hopes of eventually getting them through to civilians in Gaza, nearly half of whom are children.There has been “a five-fold increase in the total number of donors versus typical past emergencies”, said Mr Derek Madsen, chief development\\xa0officer of Anera, a non-partisan emergency relief group for refugees throughout the Middle East.The organisation, which maintains the privacy of individual donors, said it had recently received the largest single donation from an individual in its 55-year history.The majority of support comes from donors based in the US, he added, with individual donations averaging around US$138. The efforts mirror those of Jewish groups in the US and Canada, who also fundraised millions for Israel.Anera was using the last of its stocks this week to distribute meals and vegetable parcels in Gaza. Its staff of 12, like everyone in Gaza, were facing “unbelievable, unimaginable trauma”, he said.Glued to the televisionIn Ann Arbor, Michigan, Ms Rabia Shafie, national director of the Palestine Aid Society, said her group was speaking to student and Muslim groups on local university campuses and community centres to spread awareness and raise donations for the Red Crescent and UNRWA, the United Nations aid agency that serves Palestinian refugees.“The money is needed to help people survive at this point of time. Medical support is so essential,” she said.“People are glued to the television... watching the news moment to moment, and very stressed out over the situation,” said Ms Rabia, adding that it was difficult as a Palestinian American to watch “the massacre and injustice done to our people back home”.Hamas-governed Gaza is one of the most densely packed places on Earth, and its medical authorities say over 8,000 Palestinians have been killed since air strikes began, including more than 3,000 children.Mr Madsen called for a ceasefire and establishment of a humanitarian corridor “so that people literally do not starve to death, literally do not die of dehydration”.Last week, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, home to one of New York’s largest Muslim and Arab communities, hundreds of protesters called for a ceasefire with signs written in Arabic, Spanish, Hebrew and Korean.In Clifton, New Jersey, the Palestinian American Community Centre’s priorities are calling for US officials to support a ceasefire, and the hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza, said Ms Basma Bsharat, the education director of the centre.The centre has also been collecting cash donations to send on to UNRWA. It has asked people not to donate supplies, which it has no easy way of sending to those in need in Gaza.Last week, a woman came to the centre anyway, hauling bags filled with goods.  “We didn’t know how to say no,” said Ms Basma. “She was like, I just want to do something. I just want to help somehow.”“It’s a very difficult time, and the fact that we do see the support coming in it, it gives some relief,” she said. “It gives some kind of solace.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The nightmare of delivering aid during this Israel-Hamas war',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The 2.3 million people who live in Gaza are facing economic isolation and experiencing incessant bombardment. Their supplies of essential resources, including food and water, are quickly dwindling.In response, US President Joe Biden has pledged US$100 million (S$136 million) in humanitarian assistance for the citizens of Gaza.Mr Biden’s promise raises fundamental questions regarding the delivery of humanitarian aid in a war zone. Political constraints, ethical quandaries and the need to protect the security of aid workers and local communities always make the effort a logistical nightmare.In this specific predicament, US officials have to choose a strategy to deliver the aid without the perception of benefiting Hamas, a group the US and Israel both classify as a terrorist organisation.LogisticsWhen aiding people in war zones, you can’t just send money, a development strategy called “cash transfers” that has become increasingly popular due to its efficiency. Sending money can boost the supply of locally produced goods and services, and help people on the ground pay for what they need most. But injecting cash into an economy so completely cut off from the world would only stoke inflation.So the aid must consist of goods that have to be brought into Gaza, and services provided by people working as part of an aid mission. Humanitarian aid can include food and water; health, sanitation and hygiene supplies and services; and tents and other materials for shelter and settlement.Due to the closure of the border with Israel, aid can arrive in Gaza only via the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border.The US Agency for International Development, or USAid, will likely turn to its long-time partner on the ground, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, to serve as supply depots and distribute goods. That agency, originally founded in 1949 as a temporary measure until a two-state solution could be found, serves in effect as a parallel yet unelected government for Palestinian refugees.USAid will likely want to tap into UNRWA’s network of 284 schools – many of which are now transformed into humanitarian shelters housing two-thirds of the estimated one million people displaced by Israeli air strikes – and 22 hospitals to expedite distribution.PoliticsPrior to the Trump administration, the US was typically the largest single provider of aid to the West Bank and Gaza. USAid administers the lion’s share of it.Since Mr Biden took office, total yearly US assistance for the Palestinian territories has totalled around US$150 million, restored from just US$8 million in 2020 under the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, however, the US was providing more aid to the territories than it is now, with US$1 billion disbursed in the 2013 fiscal year.But the White House needs Congress to approve this assistance – a process that requires the House of Representatives to elect a new Speaker and then for lawmakers to approve aid to Gaza once that happens.EthicsThe UNRWA is a UN organisation. It is not run by Hamas, unlike, for instance, the Gaza Ministry of Health. However, Hamas has frequently undermined UNRWA’s efforts and diverted international aid for military purposes.  Hamas has repeatedly used UNRWA schools as rocket depots. It has repeatedly tunnelled beneath UNRWA schools. It has dismantled European Union-funded water pipes to use as rocket fuselages. And even since the most recent violence broke out, the UNRWA has accused Hamas of stealing fuel and food from its Gaza premises.Humanitarian aid professionals regularly have to contend with these trade-offs when deciding to what extent they can work with governments and local authorities that commit violent acts. They need to do so in exchange for the access required to help civilians under their control.Similarly, Mr Biden has had to make concessions to Israel while brokering for the freedom to send humanitarian aid to Gaza. For example, he has assured Israel that if any of the aid is diverted by Hamas, the operation will cease.This promise may have been politically necessary. But if Mr Biden already believes Hamas to be uncaring about civilian welfare, he may not expect the group to refrain from taking what it can.Security best practicesWhat can be done to protect the security of humanitarian aid operations that take place in the midst of dangerous conflicts?Under international humanitarian law, the local authorities have the primary responsibility for ensuring the delivery of aid – even when they aren’t carrying out that task. To increase the chances that the local authorities will not attack them, aid groups can give “humanitarian notification” and voluntarily alert the local government as to where they will be operating.Hamas has repeatedly flouted international norms and laws. So the question of if and how the aid convoy will be protected looms large.Under the current agreement between the US, Israel and Egypt, the convoy will raise the UN flag. International inspectors will make sure no weapons are on board the vehicles before they cross over from Arish, Egypt, to Rafah, a city located on the Gaza Strip’s border with Egypt.The aid convoy will likely cross without militarised security. This puts it at some danger of diversion once inside Gaza. But whether the aid convoy is attacked, seized or left alone, the Biden administration will have demonstrated its willingness to attempt a humanitarian relief operation. In this sense, a relatively small first convoy bearing water, medical supplies and food, among other items, serves as a test balloon for a sustained operation to follow soon after.If the US were to provide the humanitarian convoy a military escort, by contrast, Hamas could see its presence as a provocation. Washington’s support for Israel is so strong that the US could potentially be judged as a party in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.In that case, the presence of US armed forces might provoke attacks on Gaza-bound aid convoys by Hamas  fighters that otherwise would not have occurred. Combined with the mobilisation of two US Navy carrier groups in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, I’d be concerned that such a move might also stoke regional anger. It would undermine the Biden administration’s attempts to cool the situation.On UN-approved missions, aid delivery may be secured by third-party peacekeepers – meaning, in this case, personnel who are neither Israeli nor Palestinian – with the UN Security Council’s blessing. In this case, tragically, it is unlikely that such a resolution could conceivably pass such a vote, much less quickly enough to make a difference.Topher L.

       "  'Title': 'Scaling up Gaza aid effort faces tangle of challenges',\n",
       "  'Text': 'CAIRO - With a trickle of aid flowing into the besieged Gaza Strip from Egypt, humanitarian staff and diplomats face a web of political, security and logistical obstacles as they try to build up and sustain deliveries of relief.The aid is desperately needed. Supplies of food, water, medicines and fuel have been running critically low for Gaza\\'s 2.3 million people since Israel began its bombardment and \"total siege\" of the Palestinian enclave.Israel’s action is in retaliation for an attack by Hamas militants on Oct 7. But Israel\\'s conditions for inspecting and tracking the aid, security risks transporting and distributing it, and arrangement of its passage through a crossing not used during previous conflicts for large-scale relief efforts have all hampered work to get the operation off the ground.Aid began flowing through Rafah, the main exit and entry point for Gaza that does not border Israel, on Oct 21, with up to 20 trucks crossing daily since. United Nations officials say 100 trucks are required daily to meet essential needs.During past conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, aid had mainly been delivered through crossing points with Israel.The UN aid operation for the Palestinian territories has been run through Israel since the 1950s.Now aid needs to be brought in from Egypt\\'s Sinai Peninsula, an isolated region with a recent history of insurgent attacks and a heavily militarised border. \"It\\'s a huge, huge undertaking to set up a humanitarian operation\\xa0from\\xa0scratch,\" said one aid official who asked not to be named. \"We\\'re not set up like that, not even close, from the\\xa0Egyptian\\xa0side.\"BottlenecksThe aid operation was brokered in talks involving the United States, Israel and Egypt, with a deal to start with a convoy of 20 trucks clinched during a visit by US President Joe Biden to Israel last week, aid officials and diplomats say.As it began, details of an inspection system were still being worked out.Scaling up aid required a quick and light system based on random checks, such as that used for sending aid from Turkey into north-western Syria, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said.Trucks are currently driving more than 40km south along the Egypt-Israel border to be inspected before returning to Gaza.This means a lag of several hours between their entry into the crossing on the Egyptian side and their exit into Gaza. \"There are bottlenecks,\" said Ms Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, which brought some supplies into Gaza with the first convoys but has many more waiting on the Egyptian side of the border.\"What exactly are these bottlenecks? It\\'s very unclear, but I think a lot of it is basically, probably the inspection mechanism and the ability of movement inside Gaza,\" she said.Some Gaza bakeries the WFP works with have been put out of operation because of shortages of fuel, a commodity that has so far not been allowed to cross because of Israeli concerns that it could be used by Hamas.Fuel is also crucial for hospital generators and water supplies, and is fast running out.    US Special Envoy David Satterfield, who has been negotiating with Israel, Egypt and the UN to set up sustained aid deliveries, told MSNBC on Oct 22 that while the critical role of fuel was understood, the provision of food, water and medicine would continue to be the focus \"in the immediate future\".Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.BattlefieldThe US, along with other countries, has also been negotiating to get thousands of foreign passport holders out of Gaza through Rafah.Qatar has meanwhile been leading efforts for the release of hostages taken by Hamas militants during the Oct 7 attack.Two Egyptian security sources linked scaling up of aid to Hamas\\'s willingness to free hostages. From a total of more than 200 hostages, two were freed through Rafah late on Monday, with Hamas crediting Qatar and Egypt for their mediation. Two others were released last week.  The UN says delivery of aid should be unconditional.  On the Gaza side of the border, distribution will depend on the pattern of the conflict and mass displacement of residents, which could be further complicated by an expected Israeli ground operation. As intense bombardment continues, aid organisations have appealed for a humanitarian pause or ceasefire to deliver relief. Security guarantees, especially for northern Gaza where Israeli bombing is concentrated, had not been forthcoming, said Mr Rick Brennan, emergencies director for the World Health Organization. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says 35 of its staff have been killed in Gaza since Oct 7.Bombardment has damaged roads and buildings around Rafah. Not long after Sunday\\'s convoy of trucks entered the crossing, shelling from an Israeli tank hit an Egyptian position nearby, wounding several Egyptian border guards. Israel said the incident was an accident.\"We\\'re going to have to adapt the whole logistics of the operation according to what is transpiring on the battlefield,\" said Mr Griffiths. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday a ceasefire in the Israel’s war against Hamas “will not happen”, as the United Nations warned not enough aid was coming in to meet “unprecedented humanitarian needs”.Israeli ground forces fought inside the Gaza Strip and air strikes pounded the besieged Hamas-run Palestinian territory in response to the Oct 7 attack – the deadliest in Israel’s history.The intensifying military operations have sharply heightened fears for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza, where the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says more than 8,300 have been killed.In a briefing to foreign press, Mr Netanyahu said a ceasefire would amount to surrendering to Hamas, whose gunmen killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages, according to the latest Israeli figures.“Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen,” he said, vowing Israel will “fight until this battle is won”.The United States, Israel’s ally, also objected to a ceasefire.“We do not believe that a ceasefire is the right answer right now,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, adding that “pauses” to get aid into Gaza should be considered instead.As Israeli forces battled Hamas militants inside the narrow Palestinian territory and sent tanks to the outskirts of Gaza City, concern has surged about the widening humanitarian crisis.Mr Kirby said Washington was “confident” of increasing the number of aid trucks to Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt to around 100 a day.Limited aid has entered Gaza from Egypt under a US-brokered deal, but its volume has fallen far short of the hundreds of trucks a day aid agencies say are needed.Mr Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, called for the Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs,” he said.Israeli tanks on Gaza highway The Hamas attack set off the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, marked by weeks of withering aerial bombardment and three continuous nights of ground operations centred on northern Gaza, which Israel has told civilians to evacuate.Columns of Israeli tanks and armoured bulldozers were seen churning through the sand, and snipers took positions inside emptied residential buildings, in footage released by the army.Dozens of tanks advanced for more than an hour into the southern fringes of Gaza City and blocked the main north-south highway, “firing at any vehicle that tries to go on it”, an eyewitness told AFP by phone.Air strikes also cratered the road and brought down buildings, residents said, before the tanks withdrew.The Israeli ground forces were supported by heavy fire from the air and artillery, with the army striking more than 600 targets within 24 hours, up from 450 reported by the military a day earlier.Hamas said it had fired anti-tank missiles at two Israeli armoured vehicles and that “blows delivered by the resistance have prevented” Israeli troops from establishing a presence in Gaza.The Israeli military also said a woman soldier was rescued from captivity after an operation in the Hamas-run territory. The release of Ms Ori Megidish was “secured during a ground operation”, the army said, adding that she had been “medically checked” and was “doing well”.Mr Netanyahu said the international community must demand the captives remaining in Gaza “be freed immediately, unconditionally”.Hamas released a video of what it said were three women hostages, seated against a tile wall, although the time and place of the recording could not be verified.One called in an agitated tone for Mr Netanyahu to agree to Hamas’ proposed exchange of the hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Mr Netanyahu decried the clip as “cruel psychological propaganda”.‘Bombing followed us’ The more than 230 hostages – aged between a few months and above 80 – are believed to be held in a network of underground tunnels where Hamas has hid its military infrastructure from Israeli surveillance and air attacks.Israel confirmed the death of one of those missing – German-Israeli Shani Louk, 23, who was captured by Hamas when its gunmen stormed a desert music festival.Fear and desperation have spiralled in Gaza, under weeks of siege that have cut off water, food, fuel and other essentials.Internet access was severed on Friday but restored on Sunday following US pressure, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.“We made clear to the government of Israel over the weekend that communications networks needed to be restored,” he said on Monday. “It is about ensuring that vital information flows, humanitarian coordination continues and families can stay in touch.”The UN reported on Sunday that “thousands of people” had ransacked aid warehouses in Gaza.Donkey carts were lining up to load water, as safe drinking water has become scarce in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.According to the UN, all 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders – despite sheltering thousands of patients and about 117,000 displaced people.“We were displaced from our homes to the hospital,” Gaza City resident Ashraf al-Muzani, 38, said from Al-Quds hospital where he and his family have sheltered for a week. “The bombing followed us,” he added. “We haven’t been able to sleep and our children are so frightened.”‘Highest’ UN death toll Mr Lazzarini said 64 of his colleagues had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, “the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict in such a short time”.Anti-Israel anger has flared across the region and beyond.In Russia’s Muslim-majority Dagestan, police said they had arrested 60 people after a crowd stormed an airport on Sunday to attack passengers arriving from Tel Aviv.And Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the US of being responsible for what he called “deadly chaos” unfolding in the Middle East.Washington has warned Israel’s enemies – in particular Iran-allied groups – not to become more fully involved after a series of attacks across the region. Israel’s military has struck targets in Syria and traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told AFP he was “doing my duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war”.Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank where health officials say about 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire and in settler attacks since the Gaza war started.

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – As part of efforts to help the victims of the conflict in Gaza, the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) will be sending US$200,000 (S$273,000) worth of relief supplies to the war zone.The SRC said on Tuesday that the relief supplies will include items such as hygiene kits, clean water, food provisions, and medical consumables and equipment such as wheelchairs.The SRC has also deployed a staff member to Cairo, Egypt, to work with the Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC) in identifying immediate and critical needs in Gaza, and to facilitate the delivery of relief supplies in the coming days.The SRC and ERC are working closely to coordinate humanitarian aid into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing – the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.They are also scaling up efforts to provide more humanitarian assistance, the SRC said.Food, water and medical supplies have been coming through the Egyptian border, but the provided aid is simply too small to meet the huge needs on the ground, according to reports.Affected communities in the Gaza Strip have received limited humanitarian aid, said the SRC statement, adding that the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has been working under “challenging conditions” to deliver emergency assistance such as ambulance and healthcare services.“There are severe shortages of essential necessities such as fuel, water and food, while medical supplies are depleting rapidly,” said the SRC.“While some humanitarian aid has arrived in Gaza with support from the ERC and PRCS, it remains inadequate to meet the extensive needs.”SRC chief executive Benjamin William said: “We are deeply concerned about the suffering and anguish experienced by the people in Gaza. Families, children, women and the elderly are enduring unimaginable hardships.”Many victims have to walk long distances to reach safe areas and have no access to basic necessities such as shelter and water, he said.He added that damaged infrastructure and a “communication paralysis” have exacerbated the crisis, leaving victims disconnected from the outside world.“We continue to urge all parties involved to uphold their responsibilities as outlined in international humanitarian law, and prioritise the protection of civilians,” said Mr William, adding that it is important for hospitals, doctors, nurses and humanitarian workers to be protected as well.“It is essential that all parties recognise and enable unhindered critical humanitarian aid into Gaza for all the affected communities, including those who have been displaced.” Two weeks ago, the SRC launched a public fund-raising appeal for relief and recovery operations, which will close on Jan 31, 2024.The organisation earlier pledged US$150,000 to relief efforts, while the Singapore Government contributed $300,000 towards relief operations through the SRC.Members of the public who wish to make an online donation can visit redcross.sg/gazaresponse',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Singapore supports humanitarian aid, calls for civilian lives to be protected in Gaza',\n",
       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Singapore has expressed its support for the efforts of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to sustain the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and calls for all innocent civilian lives to be protected, said Singapore’s Ambassador to the UN Burhan Gafoor.“At the outset, I wish to express Singapore’s utmost support for the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to sustain the flow of humanitarian assistance to the civilians affected by this terrible tragedy in Gaza,” said Mr Gafoor.“We commend the Secretary-General for his leadership role in facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance and recognise the important contributions made by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations on the ground,” he noted.He added that Singapore supports all efforts to defuse tensions in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict.“Respect for the UN Charter and for international law has always been a fundamental guiding principle of Singapore’s foreign policy. The UN Charter and international law provide the foundation for international peace and security,” Mr Gafoor said.The ambassador made these comments at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, as Singapore voted in support of a resolution drafted by Arab states calling for an immediate humanitarian truce.The non-binding resolution received 121 votes in favour, while 44 abstained and 14 – including Israel and the United States – voted “no”. Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s retaliatory action has killed more than 7,000 people in Gaza, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry. Mr Gafoor said: “We mourn the loss and suffering of so many innocent civilians, including children and the elderly. This attack (by Hamas) cannot be condoned or justified by any rationale. We condemn this terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms. We also call for the immediate and safe release of all hostages taken by Hamas.“In this regard, it is worth recalling that just in June this year, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,” he noted. This, he said, calls for the international community to reiterate its “strong and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes”.Israel has the legitimate right to defend its citizens and its territory under international law, said Mr Gafoor.However, he also pointed out that Israel also has an obligation to comply with international humanitarian law.\\xa0“All parties must abide by international humanitarian law and do their utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians,” said the ambassador.He added that Singapore welcomes all efforts to establish and uphold safe zones and routes that will keep civilians out of harm’s way and allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. “Singapore is deeply saddened by the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the loss of so many civilian lives. This is a massive humanitarian crisis,” said Mr Gafoor.“We urge all parties involved to allow the rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and essential services to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” he added. To support humanitarian relief operations in Gaza, the Government has made a financial contribution through the Singapore Red Cross, said Mr Gafoor. Many Singaporeans have also made their own contributions to relief operations, he said, noting that it is the Republic’s hope that their contributions will reach those in need quickly. On the resolution, Mr Gafoor said that Singapore has voted in favour after very careful consideration, but added that the Republic deeply regrets that this resolution has “two glaring and significant omissions”. “First, it makes no mention of Hamas’ role in perpetrating the massive and coordinated terror attacks, which led to the brutal killing of 1,400 Israelis and others and the abduction of more than 200 hostages,” he said.“These are acts of terror that we condemn unequivocally, and the abhorrent deeds of Hamas cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever,” said the ambassador, as he reiterated Singapore’s call for the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all civilians taken hostage. “Second, this resolution\\xa0does not acknowledge Israel’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory in compliance with international law. As with every country, Israel has a right to defend itself from heinous terrorist attacks, to protect its people from senseless violence and to keep its territory secure,” he added.Nevertheless, Singapore supported the resolution as the Republic has “always been a consistent advocate and defender of international law, the UN Charter and the rules-based multilateral system”, said Mr Gafoor.\\xa0\\xa0He pointed out that the resolution reaffirms all parties’ obligations to respect and uphold international law, including international humanitarian law. “It expresses strong support for the efforts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and for his calls for the immediate and unrestricted access of humanitarian aid, and to respond to the most basic needs of the Palestinian civilian population amidst the unfolding humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip,” said Mr Gafoor.The resolution, he said, demands that all parties immediately and fully comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law.\\xa0“These obligations have been spelt out in many UN Security Council resolutions. All innocent civilian lives must be protected,” he stressed.On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr Gafoor said that it is a “longstanding one, and it must be resolved in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. He called it the only way to stop the repeated cycles of violence. “Singapore’s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been consistent. We continue to hold the view that the only viable path to a durable, just and comprehensive solution is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” he said. Mr Gafoor also stressed that Singapore calls on leaders from both sides to show leadership, to exercise restraint and to take the difficult but necessary steps towards the vision of a two-state solution.“We support the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland, and Israel’s right to live within secure borders. Both Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, security and dignity,” he added.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Aid supplies to Gaza halted again, UN says starvation imminent   ',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM – United Nations aid deliveries to Gaza were suspended again on Nov 17 due to shortages of fuel and a communications shutdown, deepening the misery of thousands of hungry and homeless Palestinians as Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the enclave. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said civilians faced the “immediate possibility of starvation” due to the lack of food supplies. Palestinian news agency Wafa said a number of Palestinians were killed and others injured in an Israeli strike that hit a group of displaced people near the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt – the transit point for aid. Al Jazeera TV cited sources as saying that nine people were killed in the strike. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the reported strike, and Reuters could not verify it.In other developments, Israel said its troops had found a tunnel shaft used by Hamas at Al-Shifa Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip.The hospital, packed with patients and displaced people and struggling to keep operating, has been a major focus of global concern this week. Israel says Hamas has stored weapons and ammunition and is holding hostages in a network of tunnels under hospitals like Shifa, using patients and people taking shelter there as human shields. Hamas denies this.With the war about to enter its seventh week, there is no sign of any let-up despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.The conflict was triggered by a cross-border raid by Hamas militants on Oct 7 that killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, in the deadliest day in the state’s 75-year-history.More than 11,500 Palestinians, at least 4,700 of them children, have now been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military assault on Hamas-ruled Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry – a toll that far surpasses previous bouts of conflict in recent years.Israel has vowed to wipe out the militant group. Whole neighbourhoods of Gaza have been flattened in air and artillery strikes, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, and the humanitarian situation is catastrophic, aid agencies say.Trucks suspendedThe UN said there would be no cross-border aid operation on Nov 17 due to fuel shortages and a communication shutdown.  For a second consecutive day on Nov 16, no aid lorries arrived in Gaza due to lack of fuel for distributing relief.WFP executive director Cindy McCain said nearly the entire population was in desperate need of food assistance.“Supplies of food and water are practically non-existent in Gaza and only a fraction of what is needed is arriving through the borders,” she said in a statement.“With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,” Ms McCain said.A UN human rights official said Israel must allow water and fuel into Gaza to restart the water supply network.“Every hour that passes with Israel preventing the provision of safe drinking water in the Gaza Strip, in brazen breach of international law, puts Gazans at risk of dying of thirst and diseases,” Mr Pedro Arrojo-Agudo said.The World Health Organisation on Nov 17 said it was very worried about the spread of disease in Gaza, citing more than 70,000 reported cases of acute respiratory infections and over 44,000 cases of diarrhoea, far more than expected.The Israeli military’s chief of staff said Israel was close to destroying Hamas’ military system in the northern Gaza Strip, and there were signs the army was taking its campaign to other parts of the coastal enclave of 2.3 million people.Israel accused Hamas of preventing people from heading to the south of the Gaza Strip, which the militant group denied.The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of Al-Shifa, Gaza’s biggest hospital.The video, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a deep hole in the ground, littered with and surrounded by concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.The army said its troops also found a vehicle in the hospital containing a large number of weapons.Reuters journalists have been unable to reach anyone inside Al-Shifa Hospital for more than 24 hours.Hamas on Nov 16 said claims by the United States that the group uses Shifa for military purposes were “a repetition of a blatantly false narrative, demonstrated by the weak and ridiculous performances of the occupation army spokesman”. Israeli officials said Hamas held some of the 240 hostages taken by gunmen on Oct 7 in the hospital complex.On Nov 17 the Israeli military said soldiers retrieved the body of a female soldier who had been held captive in a building near Shifa.The military confirmed her death on Nov 14 after Hamas issued a video of her alive, followed by images of what it said was her body after she was killed in an Israeli strike.On Nov 16, troops recovered the body of another woman hostage, also in a building near Shifa.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Hamas’ Al-Quds Brigades said they had engaged Israeli forces for several hours in the city of Jenin overnight into Nov 17, unleashing a “torrent of fire” and laying ambushes with explosives.Israel’s military said warplanes struck militants in Jenin who had opened fire on Israeli soldiers. It said at least five of the militants were killed.At least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the Oct 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The violence there has underscored fears that the territory, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, could spiral out of control in tandem with the conflict in Gaza. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'GENEVA – \\xa0The United Nations’ high commissioner for human rights on Tuesday condemned allegations of mass killings and executions by Palestinian armed groups, as he warned that Israel’s announcement of a “complete siege” of Gaza would exacerbate the “already dire” humanitarian situation in the coast.“All parties must respect international humanitarian law,” Mr Volker Turk said in a statement. “They must immediately cease attacks targeting civilians and attacks expected to cause disproportionate death and injury of civilians or damage to civilian objects.”As Israeli warplanes struck hundreds of sites on Monday, Israel’s defence minister said “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed into Gaza, which is controlled by the militant group Hamas and is under a 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt that heavily restricts access for people and goods. Mr Turk said the ability of medical facilities to treat the growing number of people wounded in Israeli strikes would be harmed by a “full siege”.  “The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,” he said. He added that restrictions on people and goods must be “justified by military necessity” or may amount to collective punishment.The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza warned on Sunday of large shortages of medicine and health equipment, as well as fuel required to keep hospital electrical generators running.Mr Turk also said he was “deeply shocked and appalled by allegations of summary executions of civilians, and, in some instances, horrifying mass killings by members of Palestinian armed groups”. He called on Palestinian armed factions to immediately release Israeli civilians who were taken hostage. About 150 people are believed to have been abducted by Palestinian gunmen in the attacks that began on Saturday.“It is horrific and deeply distressing to see images of those captured by Palestinian armed groups being ill-treated, as well as reports of killings and the desecration of their bodies,” he said. “Civilians must never be used as bargaining chips.”The World Health Organisation (WHO) called on Tuesday for a humanitarian corridor to be established into and out of the Gaza.The WHO had reported 13 attacks on health facilities in Gaza since the weekend, and that the organisation’s medical supplies stored there had already been used up.\\xa0“WHO is calling for an end to the violence… A humanitarian corridor is needed to reach people with critical medical supplies,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told journalists in Geneva.“We need supplies to come in: hospitals cannot run without fuel, without electricity.“The supplies that we have pre-positioned are already running low so we need those supplies to come,” Mr Jasarevic said.The United Nations humanitarian office said nearly 200,000 people, or nearly a tenth of the population, have fled their homes in Gaza since the start of hostilities.

       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON - Israel\\'s war Cabinet has agreed to allow 140,000 litres of fuel into Gaza every two days, after a request from Washington, amid acute shortages that threatened aid deliveries and communications in the besieged strip, Israel and US officials said on Friday.Israel imposed a strict blockade on all goods entering Hamas-controlled Gaza when it launched a military campaign in response to the Palestinian militant group\\'s Oct 7 rampage, in which they killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages.Israel has since agreed to allow in aid trucks after stringent inspections, and a small amount of fuel was allowed in on Wednesday to keep United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) aid delivery trucks moving.An Israeli official who declined to be identified said two trucks a day would be allowed in to meet the UN\\'s needs, but said the amount would give \"minimal\" support for water, sewage and sanitary systems in Gaza to prevent pandemics.A US State Department official, offering more details, said Israel had committed to allowing in 120,000 litres of fuel every 48 hours for UNRWA\\'s trucks and other needs like desalinisation of water, sewage pumping, bakeries and hospitals in the south of Gaza.An additional 20,000 litres every two days would be allowed in to power generators of telecoms company Paltel, which had warned of an imminent blackout of its cellphone network due to lack of fuel. US officials have been pushing Israel to allow fuel in for some time. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken made calls to members of Israel\\'s war Cabinet on Wednesday, and warned that the fuel shortage risked a humanitarian catastrophe among Gaza\\'s 2.3 million residents, the State Department official said. Israeli officials had previously argued that Hamas should release hostages before it eased the pressure on Gaza, the official said, adding that negotiations on the release of hostages continue separate from the move on fuel.    The Israeli official confirmed the decision came after a request from Washington, and said allowing the fuel in gives Israel extra room to maneuver in the international arena so it can continue its campaign to eradicate Hamas in Gaza.
