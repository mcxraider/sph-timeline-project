       "{'Text': 'BRUSSELS - European Council president Charles Michel said on Saturday that he had convened a video conference summit of European Union leaders on Tuesday to discuss the Hamas attacks on Israelis and Israel’s response.Mr Michel said the bloc stood in “full solidarity” with the people of Israel after the “brutal terrorist attacks” of a week ago.In an invitation letter to EU leaders, Mr Michel said Israel had the right to defend itself in compliance with international law.He said the siege of the Gaza Strip was raising alarm bells in the international community, prompting him to convene a video conference meeting on Tuesday at 5.30pm Central European Time (11.30pm Singapore time).“It is of utmost importance that the European Council, in line with the treaties and our values, sets our common position and establishes a clear unified course of action that reflects the complexity of the unfolding situation,” he wrote.Mr Michel said the EU had to be an advocate of peace and respect for international law and should seek to avoid a regional escalation of the situation.He added that the conflict had the potential to feed extremism in EU societies and could prompt migration and movements of a large number of people to neighbouring countries.

       "  'Text': 'PARIS – Countries around the world have reacted to a wave of attacks by land, sea and air carried out by Palestinian armed group Hamas that Israel says has claimed hundreds of lives. The statements by world leaders ranged from outright condemnation of the attacks and strong support for Israel from Western nations, to support for Hamas from some Middle Eastern countries. Many have called for a de-escalation of the conflict, after Israel launched air strikes and other military operations targeting Gaza that the Palestinian authorities say have killed hundreds.Here is a round-up of the reactions:United States President Joe Biden said US support for Israel was “rock solid and unwavering”. On Sunday, he ordered US ships and warplanes to move closer to Israel.Washington also promised to provide munitions and equipment to Israel, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on Sunday.Several US citizens were among those killed in Hamas’ surprise attack, according to a US National Security Council spokesperson.Iran President Ebrahim Raisi said on Sunday that Iran supported the Palestinians’ right to self-defence, and warned that Israel must be held accountable for endangering the region.A senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had already backed the attack last Saturday, calling it a “proud operation”.Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry called for “an immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, protection of civilians and self-control”.United Nations The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday, a day after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged diplomatic efforts in the Middle East to prevent wider conflict.Diplomats said the Security Council did not consider any joint statement, let alone a binding resolution, with members led by Russia hoping for a broader focus than condemning Hamas.European Union European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had already condemned the attack by Hamas last Saturday.On Sunday, she posted on X, formerly Twitter: “The full scale of the brutality of the Hamas terror attack leaves us breathless. “Defenceless people, brutally murdered in cold blood on the streets. We stand strong with Israel and its people. Today, the EU and Israeli flags fly side by side.”China “China is deeply concerned about the current escalation of tension and violence between Palestine and Israel,” a Foreign Ministry statement said on Sunday. Beijing “calls on all parties concerned to remain calm and exercise restraint, cease fire immediately, protect civilians and prevent further deterioration of the situation”, it added.Russia Russia’s Foreign Ministry called for an “immediate ceasefire” and negotiations towards “a comprehensive, lasting and long-awaited peace”, said spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is fending off a Russian invasion, said on Sunday that he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to offer condolences “for the numerous casualties caused by the terrorist attack”.He said last Saturday that Israel had an indisputable right to defend itself, adding that “terror is always a crime”.South Africa The ruling African National Congress issued a statement on Sunday saying: “It can no longer be disputed that apartheid South Africa’s history is occupied Palestine’s reality.“As a result, the decision by Palestinians to respond to the brutality of the settler Israeli apartheid regime is unsurprising.”The statement added it was clear that “the degenerating security situation is directly linked to the unlawful Israeli occupation”.France French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna held talks by telephone with several of her counterparts in the Middle East in a bid to “prevent the conflict degenerating” by spreading to other parts of the region, a ministry statement said on Sunday.France’s Foreign Ministry also called for the immediate release of the hostages taken by Hamas.Germany German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sunday that Israel has the right to defend itself against “barbaric attacks” and “to protect its citizens and to pursue the attackers”.He called Mr Netanyahu to tell him Germany stands “firmly and unwaveringly by Israel’s side”. German-Israeli nationals are among the hostages taken by Hamas, a Foreign Ministry source confirmed.Britain British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Sunday he had assured Mr Netanyahu of London’s “steadfast support”.“We will do everything that we can to help. Terrorism will not prevail,” he added in a statement.Turkey Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday urged Israel and Hamas “to support peace” and refrain from harming civilians.“There is no good in (attacking) civilians,” he said. “We are ready to do everything to reduce the tension.”Italy Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called Mr Netanyahu to reaffirm “Rome’s full solidarity” following the Hamas offensive. “Italy stands by the Israeli people at this difficult time,” said a government statement.Japan Japan “strongly condemns” the attacks, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa said on Sunday, as well as the taking of hostages by Hamas.“Meanwhile, we are seriously concerned about the large number of casualties in the Gaza Strip as a result of attacks by the Israel Defence Forces,” her statement continued, calling for restraint.Vatican City Pope Francis on Sunday said that “terrorism and war do not lead to any resolutions, but only to the death and suffering of so many innocent people.“War is a defeat! Every war is a defeat! Let us pray that there be peace in Israel and in Palestine”.India Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India stands “in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour”. “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel,” he said.Venezuela Venezuela’s government expressed its “deep concern” over the clashes.In a statement on X, it said the fighting was “the result of the impossibility of the Palestinian people to find in multilateral international legality a space to assert their historic rights”.Yemen In Yemen, Huthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa expressed their support for “the heroic jihadist operation”. In a statement on the website of the Huthi-controlled Saba news agency, the Iran-aligned militant group said the attack “revealed the weakness, fragility and impotence” of Israel. AFP',\n",

       "  'Text': 'BRUSSELS - European Union (EU) foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Nov 20 that the establishment of a Palestinian state would be the best way of ensuring Israel’s security.Mr Borrell held a video meeting with foreign ministers from the EU’s 27 countries after touring the Middle East for talks on Israel’s war with Hamas.  The EU’s top diplomat said he had drawn “a fundamental political conclusion” from his discussions across the region. “I think that the best guarantee for Israel’s security is the creation of a Palestinian state,” Mr Borrell said in a written summary of the EU meeting.Mr Borrell has insisted Israel should not occupy Gaza after the current conflict ends and that control of the territory should be handed over to the Palestinian Authority.“Despite the huge challenges, we have to advance our reflections on the stabilisation of Gaza and the future Palestinian state,” he said. In the short term, Mr Borrell said, after visiting a string of Arab states, that there was a “sense of urgency” over the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza. “The UN Security Council resolution calling for immediate humanitarian pauses is a big step forward, but we must ensure its rapid implementation,” he said. Another major fear was the possibility of the conflict further inflaming volatile situation in the West Bank and dragging in other actors in the Middle East. “In (the) light of increased extremists and settlers’ violence against Palestinians, there is a real risk that the situation could escalate,” Mr Borrell said. “Reports of a ship hijacked by the Houthis are another worrying signal of a risk of the regional spill over.” AFP',\n",

       "  'Text': 'US President Joe Biden has warned Israel that occupying Gaza “would be a big mistake”. The warning seemed to be aimed directly at voices within the Israeli government who are calling for Israel to not only destroy Hamas, but also to occupy the Palestinian territory.Mr Biden\\xa0supports Israel’s right to defend itself\\xa0and to destroy Hamas’ military capabilities. But, if history is anything to go by, then occupation – as a strategy to destroy Hamas – seems doomed to fail. The Gaza Strip\\xa0was under Israeli military occupation following the June 1967 war (it was earlier occupied by Egypt) until Israel unilaterally withdrew from the territory\\xa0in 2005. This included the removal of 21 settlements comprising 8,500 Israeli civilians who were living amid 1.4 million Palestinians. The realities of occupationThe occupation of Gaza required the diversion of significant military and economic resources to protect the settlers in a land with which most Israelis did not feel a sense of kinship. Polls\\xa0from 2004\\xa0and\\xa02005\\xa0of Israeli public opinion showed that between 53 per cent and 60 per cent supported the disengagement plan.Indeed, the recent Hamas attacks are a painful reminder of the occupation’s costs. In response to rising tensions in recent weeks in the West Bank and East Jerusalem (both occupied by Israel since 1967 and previously under Jordanian occupation), the Israeli army diverted its entire Gaza division to protect Israeli settlers in the West Bank and to prevent a deadly escalation there over the Jewish holidays. This left the Israeli military significantly under-equipped and under-manned to respond immediately and decisively to the Hamas attacks from Gaza.Already burdened by policing missions around Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and with the ever-present threat of a military confrontation with Hezbollah (the Iranian-backed Shi’ite militia group established in the early 1980s) along its northern border, the notion of a military reoccupation of Gaza by Israel would probably see its resources stretched not only beyond capacity, but also beyond its long-term interests.The Israeli government’s stated aims for its current operation have so far been vague. “Destroying Hamas’ military capabilities” may mean different things to different people – from the precise targeting of its arms and the killing of its military leaders, to destroying Hamas as an idea.What occupation cannot solveMilitary occupation is unlikely to kill the violent Hamas ideology. Indeed, it was the first Palestinian popular uprising (intifada) against the Israeli occupation in the West Bank which gave rise to\\xa0Hamas in 1987, as a younger, Islamist alternative to the Fatah leadership. Fatah, the dominant faction of the Palestinian Authority (PA) which administers the Palestinian areas in the West Bank, is a secular, nationalist party that recognises Israel – whereas Hamas does not.So any sustained military occupation of Gaza is likely to garner more support for Hamas, rather than eradicate it. It is also unlikely that the PA in the West Bank would be eager to fill the power vacuum which would be created in the unlikely event that Israel successfully eradicates Hamas altogether, for fear of being depicted as Israeli collaborators by the Palestinian people. Moreover, an occupation brings with it the responsibility of administering the daily lives of 2.3 million Palestinians. This is something that neither Israel nor the PA wants or can do in the current circumstances.Lessons from 1982Israeli leaders should also take lessons from the last time the country tried to eradicate a terrorist group and impose regime change.In 1982, the Israeli military invaded southern Lebanon to remove the threat of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) to its northern towns. It ended with a failed alliance with the Christian Phalange party in Lebanon, which directly led to the\\xa0Sabra and Shatila massacre\\xa0and an 18-year Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, ending with a\\xa0“chaotic” withdrawal in 2000. None of Israel’s options to achieve its aim of destroying Hamas’ military capabilities is easy. Relying solely on air strikes will lead to a large number of civilian casualties, and is unlikely to destroy\\xa0Hamas’ tunnels\\xa0or kill its military leaders.A ground operation will not only lead to a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented proportions, but is also likely to start a creeping, short-term occupation leading to a permanent occupation – as the history of the June 1967 and 1982 Lebanon wars shows.Since its military and civilian withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, and following Hamas’ takeover of the territory from Fatah in 2007, Israel has blockaded the strip for security reasons by air, land and sea, effectively controlling who and what is allowed to enter and leave. Egypt has similarly blockaded the southern border of the Gaza Strip by Rafah.While Israel no longer occupies Gaza – inasmuch as it is not responsible for the daily lives of Gazans – the continuous blockade has significantly contributed to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the strip. That Hamas has proven to be a more capable terrorist organisation than an effective government has only set the Palestinian quest for freedom and statehood back even further.Asaf Siniver is professor of international security, University of Birmingham.

International institutions and non-governmental organisations operating in Gaza are also due to attend.The Palestinian Authority will be present but Israel has not been invited, although it will be kept informed of the developments.The broad aim is to mobilise financial resources and find ways to get aid into the enclave, while also getting those seriously wounded out given Gaza\\'s medical infrastructure is fast collapsing. Cyprus, the closest EU member state to Gaza, has put forward an idea to get more aid into Gaza via a maritime corridor. It would expand the limited capacities beyond the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza, but the concept is tricky, four diplomats said. Israeli officials would also want to check all goods coming from Limassol port in Cyprus, the diplomats said.Who would receive the aid would also need to be clarified as there are concerns it could fall into Hamas\\' hands, two diplomats said. Israel would also want to vet what aid was going into Gaza and opposes supplying badly-needed fuel to the enclave, they said.There are also technical issues. Port infrastructure off Gaza was started in 2016, but has since been abandoned. \"Gaza doesn’t have a harbour fit for such purpose,\" said a senior EU official. \"It would require building a floating marina by a country with proper navy experience.\"Should it even go ahead, the mission\\'s safety would need to be ensured and would be likely to need a pause in fighting. FLOATING HOSPITALSOn top of the Cypriot proposal, diplomats said France has also suggested taking the idea further and expanding the corridor to evacuating people who are severely wounded onto hospital ships in the Mediterranean off the coast of Gaza.French officials have said they are discussing the issue with Israeli and Egyptian authorities, but the idea would be to get critical masse from several countries willing to send ships with the necessary medical capacity. Paris is preparing a helicopter carrier for that purpose including beds, surgical capacities, medication and personnel. It is not expected in the region for another 10 days.\"Regarding the humanitarian corridor with France, there is an idea to bring a ship with some medical capabilities.\" Col. Elad Goren, head of Israel’s Civil Department of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), told reporters on Tuesday.\"We are working with the French and with the Egyptians in order to try to build up a mechanism to evacuate wounded people, but it\\'s still ongoing.\"In a letter sent to European counterparts on Nov. 3, Italy\\'s defence minister has also said his country is ready to send a ship equipped with an intensive care ward and surgical capacities as soon as possible, two diplomats said.\"But the question is how you would get evacuated from land to ships?\" said one of the diplomats. \"On the ground first through Egypt or Israel? Directly from Gaza by sea? It\\'s very complex.\"Either way, three diplomats said that hospital ships were essentially only a temporary solution and that the aim would be to eventually set up field hospitals either close to the border in Gaza or on the Egyptian side.\"The Egyptians do not want multiple field hospitals on their side because it could be used as a pretext to push the Palestinians into the Sinai,\" said one diplomat.

The Kremlin later issued its own statement on the call, saying that Putin had told Erdogan that Russia and Turkey largely agree on the Israel-Palestinian issue.\"The positions of Russia and Turkey... are focused on the implementation of the well-known two-state formula, which envisages the creation of an independent Palestine coexisting with Israel in peace and security,\" it said.

       "  'Title': 'More questions than answers as Israeli PM Netanyahu seeks security control over Gaza',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s declaration this week that Israel would take control of security in Gaza for an indefinite period has added to uncertainty over the future of the besieged enclave, more than a month into the war.Israeli officials have since tried to make clear that they do not intend to reoccupy Gaza, from which Israeli forces withdrew in 2005. But there has been no clarity on how to ensure security without maintaining a military presence in the territory.Only one thing has been stressed repeatedly – Hamas must be destroyed.The movement launched an attack on southern Israel on Oct 7, which Israel says killed 1,400 people. Hamas also took more than 240 hostages.Israel responded to that attack with retaliatory strikes on Gaza, which is ruled by Hamas. Israel’s bombardments have killed more than 10,500 Palestinians.“They cannot be here,” former defence minister Benny Gantz, who joined Mr Netanyahu in an emergency unity government in October, said on Wednesday. “We can come up with any mechanism we think is appropriate, but Hamas will not be part of it.”Mr Gantz, who said Hamas presented an existential threat to Israel, told reporters that Israel would have to ensure “security superiority” around Gaza, but the specifics remain vague in the absence of any coherent idea of the political future.Mr Ron Dermer, one of Mr Netanyahu’s closest aides, who like Mr Gantz is in the inner war Cabinet, said Israel would have to play an active role in the oversight of Gaza.But he said that much would depend on how the enclave was governed in future.“Will there be a force that will prevent terrorism from emerging there? Will there be a Palestinian force that will build and govern Gaza the way it should for the people of Gaza, and not just to destroy Israel? That remains to be seen,” he told US network NBC on Tuesday.The war is already among the bloodiest episodes in decades of conflict.Whole swathes of the densely populated coastal strip have been flattened.More than 1.5 million people, some two-thirds of the population, have been forced from their homes, according to United Nations figures.Rebuilding the physical infrastructure and reconstructing the governance of the area will present a colossal challenge which will force Israel to work with the Palestinians, diplomats say, despite the bitter enmity on both sides.As the war continues, there have been calls from Western countries, including the United States, for a renewal of stalled efforts to agree on a two-state solution, with an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a news conference in Tokyo: “Now, the reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict, but it is imperative that Palestinian people (be) central to governance in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.“It is also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza.”Challenges aheadIsrael originally withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, drawing the wrath of hardline settlers who were forced to leave with the army when former prime minister Ariel Sharon decided the costs of maintaining a presence were too high.The challenges that are likely to confront any reshaped Israeli security mechanism have already been clearly demonstrated during more than 18 months of increasingly violent clashes in the nearby occupied West Bank.Some diplomats have mooted the possibility of a reshaped Palestinian Authority (PA) playing a role in the administration of Gaza, if Israel succeeds in its aim of dismantling Hamas.The PA used to run both Gaza and the West Bank, but was forcibly ousted from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. It now governs only sections of the West Bank, which is dotted with ever-growing Jewish settlements. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh recently told foreign reporters that the PA would not return to Gaza “on the back of an Israeli tank”.Those comments threw serious doubt on speculation that Israel will seek to offload responsibility for the day-to-day running of the enclave onto its previous masters. In any case, the PA has long struggled to impose its authority even in the West Bank. In theory, it is responsible for order in the area, but it is mistrusted by both Israel and large sections of the Palestinian population. In its place, the Israeli army has largely taken the job of combating militant activity.Over the past 18 months, Israeli troops have killed hundreds of Palestinians – hardened militant fighters, stone-throwing young people and uninvolved civilians – and made thousands of arrests across the West Bank. In the same period, dozens of Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians.Cities such as Nablus and Jenin, which earlier in 2023 was the scene of a two-day battle involving hundreds of Israeli troops backed by drones and helicopter gunships, have become strongholds for militant groups including Hamas.Mr Dermer said that while Israeli troops had physically entered West Bank towns, they had essentially been absent from Gaza for the last 17 years.  “Obviously, we can’t repeat (this). So, after Hamas is removed from power... Israel is going to have to retain over-riding security responsibility indefinitely.”Jordan’s former deputy prime minister, Mr Marwan Muasher, told Reuters he had seen no convincing initiative on how Gaza might be governed once the conflict ended.“I don’t think that there is any clear thinking yet about what to do with the day after,” said Mr Muasher, who is vice-president for studies at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

       "  'Title': 'Arab leaders at Cairo Peace Summit denounce Israel attacks on Gaza as risks to region rise',\n",
       "  'Text': 'CAIRO - Arab leaders condemned Israel’s two-week-old bombardment of Gaza on Saturday and demanded renewed efforts to reach a Middle East peace settlement to end a decades-long cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians.Speaking at a hastily convened gathering dubbed the Cairo Peace Summit, Jordan’s King Abdullah denounced what he termed global silence about Israel’s attacks on the enclave and urged an even-handed approach to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.“The message the Arab world is hearing is that Palestinian lives matter less than Israeli ones,” he said, adding he was outraged and grieved by acts of violence waged against innocent civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel.  “The Israeli leadership must realise once and for all that a state can never thrive if it is built on a foundation of injustice... Our message to the Israelis should be that we want a future of peace and security for you and the Palestinians.”Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Palestinians would not be displaced or driven off their land.“We won’t leave, we won’t leave,” he told the summit.Israel has vowed to wipe the Gaza-based Hamas militant group “off the face of the earth” over an assault on southern Israel on Oct 7, the deadliest Palestinian militant attack in Israeli history.Israel has said it told Palestinians to move south within Gaza for their own safety.The Cairo gathering is trying to find ways to head off a wider regional war, although the assembled Middle Eastern and European leaders are expected to struggle to agree a common position on the conflict between Israel and Hamas militants.Three diplomats said it was unlikely there would be a joint statement from the gathering because of sensitivities around any calls for a ceasefire, and whether to include mention of Hamas\\' Oct 7 attack on Israel and Israel\\'s right to defend itself.The absence of a top official from Israel\\'s main ally, the United States, and some other major Western leaders has cooled expectations for what the hastily-convened event can achieve.The US, which has no ambassador currently assigned to Egypt, is represented by its embassy Charge d\\'Affaires. The summit meets as Israel prepares a ground assault on Gaza following Hamas\\' attack that killed 1,400 people. More than 4,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\\'s counteroffensive, amid a growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Arab countries have voiced anger at Israel\\'s unprecedented bombardment and siege of Gaza, home to 2.3 million people.In his speech Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said his country opposed what he called the displacement of Palestinians into Egypt’s Sinai region.“Egypt says the solution to the Palestinian issue is not displacement, its only solution is justice and the Palestinians’ access to legitimate rights and living in an independent state.”Egypt is wary of insecurity near the border with Gaza in northeastern Sinai, where it faced an Islamist insurgency that peaked after 2013 and has now largely been suppressed.Egypt’s position reflects Arab fears that Palestinians could again flee or be forced from their homes en masse, as they were during the war surrounding Israel’s creation in 1948.Shortly before the opening, trucks loaded with humanitarian aid began entering the Rafah crossing into Gaza, footage from Egyptian state TV showed. Egypt had been trying for days to channel humanitarian relief to Gaza through the crossing, the one access point not controlled by Israel.Egypt has said little about the aims of the gathering, beyond an Oct 15 statement by the Egyptian presidency that the summit would cover recent developments involving the crisis in Gaza and the future of the Palestinian issue.China said its envoy for Middle East issues Zhai Jun would attend, while Russia said it would be represented by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will not attend, while there has been no official word on whether French President Emmanuel Macron will go.A senior EU official said on Friday there had been discussions about a common summit declaration but there were still \"differences\" so it was not clear if there would be a text in the end.European countries have struggled to settle on a united approach to the crisis, beyond condemning Hamas\\'s attack, after days of confusion and mixed messaging.Clashes on Israel\\'s border with Lebanon and attempted attacks by Iranian-backed forces elsewhere have fuelled fears of a spillover, particularly if a ground offensive proves bloody, while growing anti-Islamic and anti-Semitic harassment around the world has raised security concerns in many countries.

       "  'Title': \"UN and medical agencies condemn Israel's Gaza ambulance strike\",\n",
       "  'Text': \"GAZA – The United Nations Secretary-General and aid agencies working in Gaza have condemned Israel's air strike on an ambulance on Friday, which the Israeli military said – without showing evidence – was carrying Hamas militants. The Health Ministry, a hospital director and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PCRS) in the Hamas-controlled enclave have said the Israeli strike targeted a convoy of ambulances evacuating wounded people from the besieged northern Gaza area. Mr Mohammad Abu Selmeyah, the director of al-Shifa Hospital, where the ambulance was hit, said 15 people had been killed in the strike and 60 injured. Those killed and injured were mainly people standing by the hospital gate, rather than inside the vehicles, he said.Those killed and injured were mainly people standing by the hospital gate, rather than inside the vehicles, he said.Israel's military said late on Friday it would present more evidence that an ambulance it struck was being used by Hamas to transport fighters and that the group used ambulances to move militants and weapons as “a method of operation”. Hamas has denied both accusations.  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a social media post on Saturday: “I am horrified by the reported attack in Gaza on an ambulance convoy.”The World Health Organisation said it condemned the strike and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders described it as “horrendous”, and “a new low in an endless stream of unconscionable violence”.PCRS said in a statement that a group of five ambulances was seeking to transport people wounded by Israeli bombardment from the hospital in Gaza City to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt.The journey would have required crossing from the northern half of the enclave, which has now been entirely surrounded by Israeli forces, into the southern area where Israel has not yet sent ground troops, but which it is also bombarding. Mr Abu Selmeyah said the wounded people being evacuated in the convoy had their names listed at Rafah for permission to enter Egypt. Egypt's Health Ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, but a statement it put out on Friday said that 28 injured people had been expected at Rafah on that day.EvacuationIsrael's military assault, aimed at destroying Hamas, is a response to the militant group's Oct 7 attack on Israeli towns which Israel says killed 1,400 people. The health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say Israeli bombardment has killed 9,488 people. The PRCS said Friday's ambulance convoy was forced to turn back some 4km from the hospital because the road was blocked with rubble from shelling.As it returned through Gaza City, about 1km from the hospital, the lead ambulance was targeted by a missile that damaged it, wounding both its crew and the injured patient inside, the PCRS said. The organisation said it was responsible for one of the five ambulances in the convoy carrying a 35-year-old woman with shrapnel injuries. It said as it was unloading the woman from the ambulance at the hospital gate, another missile struck the vehicle, injuring the driver and a medic.     Videos verified by Reuters of the aftermath showed numerous people lying prone in pools of blood near ambulances. Doctors Without Borders quoted one of its doctors working at al-Shifa hospital, whom it identified as Dr Obaid, saying: “We were standing inside the hospital gate when the ambulance was directly hit in front of us. There were bloody bodies everywhere.”Asked about the incident, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva said: “We are heartbroken to see medical services in Gaza put in harm's way.”The ICRC spokesperson said the PRCS, which said it owned one of the ambulances in the convoy, has “a strong track record providing life-saving services. Like all the organisations forming part of the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement, they are bound by principles of neutrality and impartiality”. REUTERS\",\n",

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Singapore “deeply regrets” the impact of Israel’s military operations on Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Nov 17.“We strongly urge Israel to do its utmost to protect all civilians and medical facilities in Gaza. We urge all parties to comply fully with international humanitarian law,” it said in a statement.“Civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, should be protected.”\\xa0MFA also said that Hamas should not use these premises for military purposes or civilians as human shields, and reiterated its call for the immediate and safe release of civilian hostages in Gaza.On Nov 15, Israeli troops entered Al-Shifa, Gaza’s biggest hospital, following a days-long siege that has caused global alarm over the fate of civilians trapped inside. Reuters quoted a Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson as saying that there was no water, food or baby milk in the hospital, which was packed with 650 patients and about 7,000 people displaced by weeks of Israeli air strikes and artillery bombardments. MFA also said that Singapore remains deeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Palestinian civilians have borne the brunt of Israel’s weeks-long military campaign in retaliation for an Oct 7 attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel also says that Hamas took more than 240 hostages. Singapore welcomed the adoption of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2712, which calls for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors in Gaza. The resolution was adopted by the Security Council on Wednesday, with 12 members voting in favour, none against and three abstentions (Russia, Britain and the United States). “Every effort must be made for the immediate, safe and unhindered provision of humanitarian aid to affected civilians throughout Gaza,” MFA added. The Al-Shifa Hospital has become the main target of Israel’s ground operation.The Israeli military has claimed that Hamas has its headquarters in tunnels beneath the facility, which the Palestinian militant group denies. MFA said that Singapore will continue to work closely with its humanitarian partners to offer additional assistance and support to the Palestinian people. Reuters reported that Gaza health authorities deemed reliable by the UN had said that at least 11,500 people have been confirmed killed, more than 4,700 of them children, in the Israeli bombardment and ground invasion.Since the war began, more than two-thirds of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have fled their homes.

The conference will be at head of state, government and foreign minister level. Key regional stakeholders such as Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf Arab countries will be invited as well as Western and European powers and Group of 20 members, excluding Russia.International institutions, including the United Nations and Arab League, and non-governmental organisations operating in Gaza, will also be present, the diplomats said.The Palestinian Authority would be present, but Israel was not set to be invited, they said, adding that Paris would inform Israel of the initiative and the work carried out at the conference.The conference will aim to mobilise financial resources with several sectors identified for emergency support based on UN assessments of the immediate needs and the opening of strictly humanitarian crossing points into Gaza. Re-establishing the supply of water, fuel and electricity would be under discussion, while ensuring accountability processes to ensure aid was not diverted to Hamas. “The conference will also enable all participants to take stock of the support already being channelled to civilians in Gaza, assess requirements and announce fresh commitments, whether financial or in kind,” according to a diplomatic note seen by Reuters. “The conference will furthermore serve as a forum for reiterating the obligation to respect international humanitarian law,” it said.France is sending two helicopter carriers off the coast of Gaza as it works with Israeli and Egyptian authorities to find a way to provide medical assistance to people affected by the bombings in the besieged area.The diplomats said there would be a discussion to set up a maritime corridor to use sea lanes to ship humanitarian aid into Gaza, but also to see how ships could be used to help the wounded evacuated from Gaza.“It is not so clear what results this will bring, but it is the right thing to do for Europe,” said one of the diplomats.

       "  'Text': 'MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin called on Nov 21 for a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and said regional states and members of the Brics group of countries could be involved in efforts to reach such a settlement.In televised comments to a virtual Brics summit, Mr Putin once again blamed the Middle East crisis on the failure of United States diplomacy in the region.“We call for the joint efforts of the international community aimed at de-escalating the situation, a ceasefire and finding a political solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. And the Brics states and countries of the region could play a key role in this work,” Mr Putin said.He did not elaborate on how such an effort might be organised. The Brics group includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. It agreed in August to expand by adding Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates as members.Russian and Western policy experts say Mr Putin is trying to use the Gaza crisis to his geopolitical advantage as part of a strategy to court allies in developing countries and build what he calls a new world order to counter US dominance.In previous comments he has repeatedly attacked US policy, urged Israel to show restraint and expressed sympathy for the plight of Palestinians.In October, he cautioned Israel against laying siege to Gaza in the same way Nazi Germany besieged Leningrad during World War II, saying a ground offensive there would lead to an “absolutely unacceptable” number of civilian casualties.On Nov 21, he said it was “terrible” that Palestinian children were dying in large numbers, adding that the sight of operations being performed on children without anaesthetics “evokes special feelings”.“Due to the sabotage of UN (United Nations) decisions, which clearly provide for the creation and peaceful coexistence of two independent and sovereign states – Israel and Palestine – more than one generation of Palestinians has been brought up in an atmosphere of injustice towards their people, and the Israelis cannot fully guarantee the security of their state,” Mr Putin said.

       "  'Title': 'Israel-Hamas war won’t affect Paris 2024 Olympic Games security plans: Tony Estanguet',\n",
       "  'Text': 'MUMBAI – The war between Israel and militant group Hamas will not affect the security plans for 2024 Olympics, the chief of the Paris Games organising committee said on Monday.There have been protests linked to the Middle East conflict recently, with France being home to Europe’s largest Muslim and Jewish communities. It was put on its highest security alert on Friday after a teacher was killed in an Islamist attack.French President Emmanuel Macron ordered the deployment of up to 7,000 soldiers for increased security patrols, as bomb alerts forced the evacuation of the Louvre Museum and Palace of Versailles. Security at the Belgian border was also stepped up on Tuesday after a shooting incident in Brussels before a Euro 2024 qualifier between Belgium and Sweden a day earlier.Belgian police on Tuesday shot dead a 45-year-old Tunisian who was suspected of killing two Swedes heading to the match, which was abandoned at half-time.Macron on Tuesday denounced hostage-taking as an “ignominy” after Hamas aired a video of a Franco-Israeli woman it kidnapped.The Elysee presidential palace said Macron “calls for her immediate and unconditional release”, adding: “France is fully mobilised and is working with its partners to free French hostages held by Hamas”.“We will not change our plans with what is happening at the moment because since the beginning we are at the best level in terms of security with Paris 2024,” said Tony Estanguet, the president of the organising committee for the July 26-Aug 11 Games.“We anticipated a lot what we need. From the year 2020, we know very carefully how many people we need venue by venue, day by day and we continue to work with the public authorities to guarantee the security.“So again, I’m very confident because there is a strong commitment coming from our partners to guarantee the security.”French police used tear gas and water cannon to break up a banned rally in support of Palestinian people in Paris recently, as Mr Macron urged the French to remain united and refrain from bringing the Israel-Hamas conflict home.The country has been targeted by a series of terrorist attacks over the years, the worst being a simultaneous assault by gunmen and suicide bombers on entertainment venues and cafes in Paris in November 2015.For the 2024 Olympics, France will deploy some 35,000 security agents and the military to secure the opening ceremony alone, a river parade through the heart of Paris, from threats including drone strikes.Hundreds of thousands of spectators are expected to line the Seine river along the 6km route to watch the delegations sail in a flotilla of boats, from the Austerlitz Bridge to the foot of the Eiffel Tower, in the first Olympic opening ceremony of this size staged outside a stadium.“From the beginning of the journey, security is really a part of the project,” Estanguet said after a Paris 2024 presentation at the International Olympic Committee meeting in Mumbai.“We had a terrorist attack in 2015 and it was in the middle of the beginning of this project. So from the beginning, I think the public authorities with Paris 2024 set security as the No. 1 priority in the success of the Games.” Los Angeles 2028 chairman Casey Wasserman on Monday said he hoped the Olympics could be a “beacon of light and hope” for the world, as he lamented the conflict in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. Wasserman, citing the deaths of 11 Israelis killed by Palestinian gunmen at the 1972 Munich Games, added: “Unfortunately, the Olympics are not immune to the world we live in.“At its worst, it is a platform for hate to express itself on the stage and we will always remember the 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team who were taken hostage and murdered in Munich.“But at its best, it is an opportunity for sport to show the world a better path with peace and unity, and we will always remember the triumph of Jesse Owens in the face of unspeakable evil,” he said.Owens, an African-American track and field athlete, won four gold medals at the Berlin Olympics in 1936, when Germany was under the Nazi regime.

       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday a ceasefire in the Israel’s war against Hamas “will not happen”, as the United Nations warned not enough aid was coming in to meet “unprecedented humanitarian needs”.Israeli ground forces fought inside the Gaza Strip and air strikes pounded the besieged Hamas-run Palestinian territory in response to the Oct 7 attack – the deadliest in Israel’s history.The intensifying military operations have sharply heightened fears for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza, where the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says more than 8,300 have been killed.In a briefing to foreign press, Mr Netanyahu said a ceasefire would amount to surrendering to Hamas, whose gunmen killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages, according to the latest Israeli figures.“Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen,” he said, vowing Israel will “fight until this battle is won”.The United States, Israel’s ally, also objected to a ceasefire.“We do not believe that a ceasefire is the right answer right now,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, adding that “pauses” to get aid into Gaza should be considered instead.As Israeli forces battled Hamas militants inside the narrow Palestinian territory and sent tanks to the outskirts of Gaza City, concern has surged about the widening humanitarian crisis.Mr Kirby said Washington was “confident” of increasing the number of aid trucks to Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt to around 100 a day.Limited aid has entered Gaza from Egypt under a US-brokered deal, but its volume has fallen far short of the hundreds of trucks a day aid agencies say are needed.Mr Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, called for the Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs,” he said.Israeli tanks on Gaza highway The Hamas attack set off the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, marked by weeks of withering aerial bombardment and three continuous nights of ground operations centred on northern Gaza, which Israel has told civilians to evacuate.Columns of Israeli tanks and armoured bulldozers were seen churning through the sand, and snipers took positions inside emptied residential buildings, in footage released by the army.Dozens of tanks advanced for more than an hour into the southern fringes of Gaza City and blocked the main north-south highway, “firing at any vehicle that tries to go on it”, an eyewitness told AFP by phone.Air strikes also cratered the road and brought down buildings, residents said, before the tanks withdrew.The Israeli ground forces were supported by heavy fire from the air and artillery, with the army striking more than 600 targets within 24 hours, up from 450 reported by the military a day earlier.Hamas said it had fired anti-tank missiles at two Israeli armoured vehicles and that “blows delivered by the resistance have prevented” Israeli troops from establishing a presence in Gaza.The Israeli military also said a woman soldier was rescued from captivity after an operation in the Hamas-run territory. The release of Ms Ori Megidish was “secured during a ground operation”, the army said, adding that she had been “medically checked” and was “doing well”.Mr Netanyahu said the international community must demand the captives remaining in Gaza “be freed immediately, unconditionally”.Hamas released a video of what it said were three women hostages, seated against a tile wall, although the time and place of the recording could not be verified.One called in an agitated tone for Mr Netanyahu to agree to Hamas’ proposed exchange of the hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Mr Netanyahu decried the clip as “cruel psychological propaganda”.‘Bombing followed us’ The more than 230 hostages – aged between a few months and above 80 – are believed to be held in a network of underground tunnels where Hamas has hid its military infrastructure from Israeli surveillance and air attacks.Israel confirmed the death of one of those missing – German-Israeli Shani Louk, 23, who was captured by Hamas when its gunmen stormed a desert music festival.Fear and desperation have spiralled in Gaza, under weeks of siege that have cut off water, food, fuel and other essentials.Internet access was severed on Friday but restored on Sunday following US pressure, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.“We made clear to the government of Israel over the weekend that communications networks needed to be restored,” he said on Monday. “It is about ensuring that vital information flows, humanitarian coordination continues and families can stay in touch.”The UN reported on Sunday that “thousands of people” had ransacked aid warehouses in Gaza.Donkey carts were lining up to load water, as safe drinking water has become scarce in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.According to the UN, all 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders – despite sheltering thousands of patients and about 117,000 displaced people.“We were displaced from our homes to the hospital,” Gaza City resident Ashraf al-Muzani, 38, said from Al-Quds hospital where he and his family have sheltered for a week. “The bombing followed us,” he added. “We haven’t been able to sleep and our children are so frightened.”‘Highest’ UN death toll Mr Lazzarini said 64 of his colleagues had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, “the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict in such a short time”.Anti-Israel anger has flared across the region and beyond.In Russia’s Muslim-majority Dagestan, police said they had arrested 60 people after a crowd stormed an airport on Sunday to attack passengers arriving from Tel Aviv.And Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the US of being responsible for what he called “deadly chaos” unfolding in the Middle East.Washington has warned Israel’s enemies – in particular Iran-allied groups – not to become more fully involved after a series of attacks across the region. Israel’s military has struck targets in Syria and traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told AFP he was “doing my duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war”.Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank where health officials say about 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire and in settler attacks since the Gaza war started.

       "  'Title': 'UN human rights chief condemns Palestinian violence, warns against ‘siege’ of Gaza',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GENEVA – \\xa0The United Nations’ high commissioner for human rights on Tuesday condemned allegations of mass killings and executions by Palestinian armed groups, as he warned that Israel’s announcement of a “complete siege” of Gaza would exacerbate the “already dire” humanitarian situation in the coast.“All parties must respect international humanitarian law,” Mr Volker Turk said in a statement. “They must immediately cease attacks targeting civilians and attacks expected to cause disproportionate death and injury of civilians or damage to civilian objects.”As Israeli warplanes struck hundreds of sites on Monday, Israel’s defence minister said “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed into Gaza, which is controlled by the militant group Hamas and is under a 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt that heavily restricts access for people and goods. Mr Turk said the ability of medical facilities to treat the growing number of people wounded in Israeli strikes would be harmed by a “full siege”.  “The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,” he said. He added that restrictions on people and goods must be “justified by military necessity” or may amount to collective punishment.The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza warned on Sunday of large shortages of medicine and health equipment, as well as fuel required to keep hospital electrical generators running.Mr Turk also said he was “deeply shocked and appalled by allegations of summary executions of civilians, and, in some instances, horrifying mass killings by members of Palestinian armed groups”. He called on Palestinian armed factions to immediately release Israeli civilians who were taken hostage. About 150 people are believed to have been abducted by Palestinian gunmen in the attacks that began on Saturday.“It is horrific and deeply distressing to see images of those captured by Palestinian armed groups being ill-treated, as well as reports of killings and the desecration of their bodies,” he said. “Civilians must never be used as bargaining chips.”The World Health Organisation (WHO) called on Tuesday for a humanitarian corridor to be established into and out of the Gaza.The WHO had reported 13 attacks on health facilities in Gaza since the weekend, and that the organisation’s medical supplies stored there had already been used up.\\xa0“WHO is calling for an end to the violence… A humanitarian corridor is needed to reach people with critical medical supplies,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told journalists in Geneva.“We need supplies to come in: hospitals cannot run without fuel, without electricity.“The supplies that we have pre-positioned are already running low so we need those supplies to come,” Mr Jasarevic said.The United Nations humanitarian office said nearly 200,000 people, or nearly a tenth of the population, have fled their homes in Gaza since the start of hostilities.

       "  'Title': 'Blinken rebuffs Arab states’ push for immediate Gaza ceasefire',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/AMMAN - \\xa0Arab leaders publicly pressed US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday to secure an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, hours after Palestinians said an Israeli air strike killed at least 15 people in a United Nations-run school being used as a shelter.In a rare open display of disagreement, the United States’ top diplomat pushed back as he stood next to his Jordanian and Egyptian counterparts at a press conference, saying a ceasefire would only let Hamas militants regroup.World and regional powers have failed to reach any consensus on how to deal with the escalating conflict in the four weeks since Israel and Hamas went to war on Oct 7, when the Islamist militant Palestinian group raided Israel from Gaza, in a rampage Israel says killed 1,400 people, with more than 240 others taken hostage.Israel has since struck Gaza from the air, imposed a siege and launched a ground assault, stirring global alarm at humanitarian conditions in the enclave, Gaza health officials said on Saturday, killing more than 9,488 Palestinians.Mr Blinken met the Saudi, Qatari, Emirati, Egyptian and Jordanian foreign ministers in Amman. “Right now we have to make sure that this war stops,” Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told the press conference afterwards.Mr Blinken said all were agreed on the need for peace and that the current status quo in Gaza could not hold, but he acknowledged there were differences between Washington and its allies.“A ceasefire now would simply leave Hamas in place, able to regroup and repeat what it did on Oct 7,” said Mr Blinken, who was on his second trip to the region since Israel and Hamas went to war.Washington has maintained its robust support for Israel but has also begun advocating for temporary humanitarian pauses to allow aid into Gaza. On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rebuffed a pause proposal from Mr Blinken after a day of meetings.On Saturday, when asked by reporters if there was any progress on achieving a humanitarian pause, US President Joe Biden said “Yes” and gave a thumbs-up as he left a church in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.‘One strike hit the schoolyard’More than 60 hostages abducted during the Oct 7 attacks in southern Israel were missing because of Israeli air strikes on Gaza, the armed wing of Palestinian militant faction Hamas said, adding that the bodies of 23 hostages were trapped under rubble. Reuters could not immediately verify the statement.Palestinian witnesses said Israel struck the Al-Fakhoura school in Jabalia, where thousands of evacuees were living, on Saturday morning.The Israeli military said a preliminary inquiry suggested it had not targeted the location “but the explosion may have been a result of IDF fire aimed at another target”. The circumstances were “under review,” it added.Reuters footage of the aftermath showed broken furniture and other belongings lying on the ground, patches of blood on the ground and on food, and people crying.“I was standing here when three bombings happened, I carried a body and another decapitated body with my own hands,” a young boy said in video obtained by Reuters, crying in despair. “God will take my vengeance.”Nearby, a resident comforted a woman in shock.One man asked angrily: “Since when has it become normal to strike shelters? This is so unfair.”Ms Juliette Touma, director of communications for the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), confirmed the UN-run school, which is in the Gaza City area, had been hit.“At least one strike hit the schoolyard where there were tents for displaced families. Another strike hit inside the school where women were baking bread,” Ms Touma said by phone.The ministry of health in Gaza said another Israeli missile strike killed two women at the door of the Nasser Children’s Hospital. Several more people were injured, it said. There was no immediate Israeli response to that report.A series of reported air strikes over the past week have devastated parts of the Jabalia refugee camp, the largest of several refugee settlements in Gaza, killing at least 195 people, according to Palestinian authorities.‘Displacements, border clashes’On Saturday, police held back protesters demonstrating outside the residence of Mr Netanyahu, amid widespread anger in Israel over the failures that led to the Hamas attacks last month. The protest coincided with a poll showing more than three-quarters of Israelis believe he should resign.Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told a press conference that Israel’s forces had delivered a “hard blow” to Hamas, destroying communications hubs, bunkers and tunnel networks over the past two days and killing 12 commanders since the start of the war.Israel last month ordered all civilians to leave the northern part of Gaza, including Gaza City, and head to the southern part of the enclave.The military said it would enable Palestinians to travel on a main Gaza highway, the Salah a-Din road, during a three-hour window on Saturday afternoon. “If you care about yourself and your loved ones, heed our instruction to head south,” it said in a social media post in Arabic.Several residents told Reuters they were too afraid to use the road. Many posted warnings on social media that Israeli tanks were stationed there.US Special Envoy David Satterfield said in Amman that between 800,000 and a million people had moved to the south of the Gaza Strip, while 350,000 to 400,000 others remained in northern Gaza City and its environs.Israel has imposed a full blockade on Gaza and allowed very little aid in from Egypt, saying it fears it would be stolen by Hamas. Mr Satterfield said there were no recorded instances of Hamas seizing aid.In what appeared to presage a widening of Israel’s ground offensive, the military issued footage showing armoured bulldozers churning up northern Gaza areas in what it described as “creating access routes for forces”.A combined tank and combat engineering unit carried out a “pinpoint raid” in the southern Gaza Strip “to map out buildings and neutralise explosives”, it said.Lebanon’s Hezbollah said it carried out simultaneous attacks on Israeli positions at the Lebanese border on Saturday, as residents of south Lebanon reported some of the fiercest Israeli strikes yet during weeks of cross-border clashes.Pro-Palestinian protests took place on Saturday in European capitals including London, Berlin and Paris to call for an immediate ceasefire.

       "  'Text': 'WASHINGTON  -The White House on Thursday said it was exploring a series of pauses in the Israel-Hamas conflict to help people safely exit Gaza and allow humanitarian aid to get in, but reiterated its opposition to a full ceasefire.National security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that such pauses should be temporary and localized, and insisted they would not stop Israel from defending itself.\"What we\\'re trying to do is explore the idea of as many pauses as might be necessary to continue to get aid out and to continue to work to get people out safely, including hostages,\" he told reporters at a regular White House briefing. President Joe Biden spoke on Wednesday about the need for a pause to provide time for the release of hostages held by Hamas, but has ruled out calling for a full ceasefire.His fellow Democrat, Senator Dick Durbin, on Thursday told CNN it was time for a ceasefire, while Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, called for a humanitarian pause to allow critical aid to reach civilians.United Nations experts are also urging a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, saying time is running out for Palestinian people there who find themselves at \"grave risk of genocide.\"Israel says it is aiming its attacks at Hamas, not civilians, and accuses the group of using them as human shields.Nearly four weeks of Israeli bombardment against the Gaza Strip in retaliation for deadly attacks by Hamas gunmen in southern Israel on Oct. 7 have killed at least 9,061 people, made up of a majority of women and children, health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave say.The White House on Thursday said 79 of its citizens have left the Gaza Strip in the two days since a crossing opened to Egypt, and it hoped more could be released in coming days, but conceded the situation remained \"fluid.\"Kirby told reporters that 55 more aid trucks were expected to enter Gaza on Thursday, bringing the total to more than 220, but said increasing aid remained a top priority for Biden.He said the United States was speaking with Israel daily and urging it to avoid civilian casualties. He noted that U.S. military officers had traveled to Israel to share lessons learned in past urban conflicts but they had since returned home, and Washington was not helping Israel with its targeting.\"There are things you can do from the ground that you can\\'t do from the air, particularly if you have good intelligence,\" he said, without elaborating.\"We\\'re doing everything we can to work with our Israeli counterparts to try to minimize the risk of civilian deaths and collateral damage,\" Kirby said. \"We are giving them the tools, including perspective and advice but also weapons, to be able to conduct these operations in the most efficient way possible, and in a way that minimizes civilian harm.\"Kirby said the scope of Israel\\'s operations showed \"they are making efforts to try to minimize civilian casualties,\" adding it was clear that some casualties were still occurring.Asked if the United States bore responsibility for civilian deaths if it was providing such weapons, Kirby insisted that Washington was not \"making the targeting decisions.\" REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The nightmare of delivering aid during this Israel-Hamas war',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The 2.3 million people who live in Gaza are facing economic isolation and experiencing incessant bombardment. Their supplies of essential resources, including food and water, are quickly dwindling.In response, US President Joe Biden has pledged US$100 million (S$136 million) in humanitarian assistance for the citizens of Gaza.Mr Biden’s promise raises fundamental questions regarding the delivery of humanitarian aid in a war zone. Political constraints, ethical quandaries and the need to protect the security of aid workers and local communities always make the effort a logistical nightmare.In this specific predicament, US officials have to choose a strategy to deliver the aid without the perception of benefiting Hamas, a group the US and Israel both classify as a terrorist organisation.LogisticsWhen aiding people in war zones, you can’t just send money, a development strategy called “cash transfers” that has become increasingly popular due to its efficiency. Sending money can boost the supply of locally produced goods and services, and help people on the ground pay for what they need most. But injecting cash into an economy so completely cut off from the world would only stoke inflation.So the aid must consist of goods that have to be brought into Gaza, and services provided by people working as part of an aid mission. Humanitarian aid can include food and water; health, sanitation and hygiene supplies and services; and tents and other materials for shelter and settlement.Due to the closure of the border with Israel, aid can arrive in Gaza only via the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border.The US Agency for International Development, or USAid, will likely turn to its long-time partner on the ground, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, to serve as supply depots and distribute goods. That agency, originally founded in 1949 as a temporary measure until a two-state solution could be found, serves in effect as a parallel yet unelected government for Palestinian refugees.USAid will likely want to tap into UNRWA’s network of 284 schools – many of which are now transformed into humanitarian shelters housing two-thirds of the estimated one million people displaced by Israeli air strikes – and 22 hospitals to expedite distribution.PoliticsPrior to the Trump administration, the US was typically the largest single provider of aid to the West Bank and Gaza. USAid administers the lion’s share of it.Since Mr Biden took office, total yearly US assistance for the Palestinian territories has totalled around US$150 million, restored from just US$8 million in 2020 under the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, however, the US was providing more aid to the territories than it is now, with US$1 billion disbursed in the 2013 fiscal year.But the White House needs Congress to approve this assistance – a process that requires the House of Representatives to elect a new Speaker and then for lawmakers to approve aid to Gaza once that happens.EthicsThe UNRWA is a UN organisation. It is not run by Hamas, unlike, for instance, the Gaza Ministry of Health. However, Hamas has frequently undermined UNRWA’s efforts and diverted international aid for military purposes.  Hamas has repeatedly used UNRWA schools as rocket depots. It has repeatedly tunnelled beneath UNRWA schools. It has dismantled European Union-funded water pipes to use as rocket fuselages. And even since the most recent violence broke out, the UNRWA has accused Hamas of stealing fuel and food from its Gaza premises.Humanitarian aid professionals regularly have to contend with these trade-offs when deciding to what extent they can work with governments and local authorities that commit violent acts. They need to do so in exchange for the access required to help civilians under their control.Similarly, Mr Biden has had to make concessions to Israel while brokering for the freedom to send humanitarian aid to Gaza. For example, he has assured Israel that if any of the aid is diverted by Hamas, the operation will cease.This promise may have been politically necessary. But if Mr Biden already believes Hamas to be uncaring about civilian welfare, he may not expect the group to refrain from taking what it can.Security best practicesWhat can be done to protect the security of humanitarian aid operations that take place in the midst of dangerous conflicts?Under international humanitarian law, the local authorities have the primary responsibility for ensuring the delivery of aid – even when they aren’t carrying out that task. To increase the chances that the local authorities will not attack them, aid groups can give “humanitarian notification” and voluntarily alert the local government as to where they will be operating.Hamas has repeatedly flouted international norms and laws. So the question of if and how the aid convoy will be protected looms large.Under the current agreement between the US, Israel and Egypt, the convoy will raise the UN flag. International inspectors will make sure no weapons are on board the vehicles before they cross over from Arish, Egypt, to Rafah, a city located on the Gaza Strip’s border with Egypt.The aid convoy will likely cross without militarised security. This puts it at some danger of diversion once inside Gaza. But whether the aid convoy is attacked, seized or left alone, the Biden administration will have demonstrated its willingness to attempt a humanitarian relief operation. In this sense, a relatively small first convoy bearing water, medical supplies and food, among other items, serves as a test balloon for a sustained operation to follow soon after.If the US were to provide the humanitarian convoy a military escort, by contrast, Hamas could see its presence as a provocation. Washington’s support for Israel is so strong that the US could potentially be judged as a party in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.In that case, the presence of US armed forces might provoke attacks on Gaza-bound aid convoys by Hamas  fighters that otherwise would not have occurred. Combined with the mobilisation of two US Navy carrier groups in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, I’d be concerned that such a move might also stoke regional anger. It would undermine the Biden administration’s attempts to cool the situation.On UN-approved missions, aid delivery may be secured by third-party peacekeepers – meaning, in this case, personnel who are neither Israeli nor Palestinian – with the UN Security Council’s blessing. In this case, tragically, it is unlikely that such a resolution could conceivably pass such a vote, much less quickly enough to make a difference.Topher L.

       "  'Title': 'Singapore supports humanitarian aid, calls for civilian lives to be protected in Gaza',\n",
       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Singapore has expressed its support for the efforts of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to sustain the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and calls for all innocent civilian lives to be protected, said Singapore’s Ambassador to the UN Burhan Gafoor.“At the outset, I wish to express Singapore’s utmost support for the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to sustain the flow of humanitarian assistance to the civilians affected by this terrible tragedy in Gaza,” said Mr Gafoor.“We commend the Secretary-General for his leadership role in facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance and recognise the important contributions made by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations on the ground,” he noted.He added that Singapore supports all efforts to defuse tensions in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict.“Respect for the UN Charter and for international law has always been a fundamental guiding principle of Singapore’s foreign policy. The UN Charter and international law provide the foundation for international peace and security,” Mr Gafoor said.The ambassador made these comments at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, as Singapore voted in support of a resolution drafted by Arab states calling for an immediate humanitarian truce.The non-binding resolution received 121 votes in favour, while 44 abstained and 14 – including Israel and the United States – voted “no”. Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s retaliatory action has killed more than 7,000 people in Gaza, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry. Mr Gafoor said: “We mourn the loss and suffering of so many innocent civilians, including children and the elderly. This attack (by Hamas) cannot be condoned or justified by any rationale. We condemn this terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms. We also call for the immediate and safe release of all hostages taken by Hamas.“In this regard, it is worth recalling that just in June this year, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,” he noted. This, he said, calls for the international community to reiterate its “strong and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes”.Israel has the legitimate right to defend its citizens and its territory under international law, said Mr Gafoor.However, he also pointed out that Israel also has an obligation to comply with international humanitarian law.\\xa0“All parties must abide by international humanitarian law and do their utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians,” said the ambassador.He added that Singapore welcomes all efforts to establish and uphold safe zones and routes that will keep civilians out of harm’s way and allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. “Singapore is deeply saddened by the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the loss of so many civilian lives. This is a massive humanitarian crisis,” said Mr Gafoor.“We urge all parties involved to allow the rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and essential services to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” he added. To support humanitarian relief operations in Gaza, the Government has made a financial contribution through the Singapore Red Cross, said Mr Gafoor. Many Singaporeans have also made their own contributions to relief operations, he said, noting that it is the Republic’s hope that their contributions will reach those in need quickly. On the resolution, Mr Gafoor said that Singapore has voted in favour after very careful consideration, but added that the Republic deeply regrets that this resolution has “two glaring and significant omissions”. “First, it makes no mention of Hamas’ role in perpetrating the massive and coordinated terror attacks, which led to the brutal killing of 1,400 Israelis and others and the abduction of more than 200 hostages,” he said.“These are acts of terror that we condemn unequivocally, and the abhorrent deeds of Hamas cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever,” said the ambassador, as he reiterated Singapore’s call for the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all civilians taken hostage. “Second, this resolution\\xa0does not acknowledge Israel’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory in compliance with international law. As with every country, Israel has a right to defend itself from heinous terrorist attacks, to protect its people from senseless violence and to keep its territory secure,” he added.Nevertheless, Singapore supported the resolution as the Republic has “always been a consistent advocate and defender of international law, the UN Charter and the rules-based multilateral system”, said Mr Gafoor.\\xa0\\xa0He pointed out that the resolution reaffirms all parties’ obligations to respect and uphold international law, including international humanitarian law. “It expresses strong support for the efforts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and for his calls for the immediate and unrestricted access of humanitarian aid, and to respond to the most basic needs of the Palestinian civilian population amidst the unfolding humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip,” said Mr Gafoor.The resolution, he said, demands that all parties immediately and fully comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law.\\xa0“These obligations have been spelt out in many UN Security Council resolutions. All innocent civilian lives must be protected,” he stressed.On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr Gafoor said that it is a “longstanding one, and it must be resolved in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. He called it the only way to stop the repeated cycles of violence. “Singapore’s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been consistent. We continue to hold the view that the only viable path to a durable, just and comprehensive solution is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” he said. Mr Gafoor also stressed that Singapore calls on leaders from both sides to show leadership, to exercise restraint and to take the difficult but necessary steps towards the vision of a two-state solution.“We support the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland, and Israel’s right to live within secure borders. Both Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, security and dignity,” he added.',\n",

       "  'Text': 'WASHINGTON - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Israel on Friday to voice solidarity with its retaliation against Hamas in Gaza but also to reassert the need to minimise Palestinian civilian casualties, his spokesperson said on Wednesday.Mr Blinken\\'s trip, which includes a stop in Jordan, is his second to the Middle East in less than a month.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials and receive an update on Israel\\'s military objectives and its plans to achieve those goals.\"He will reiterate US support for Israel’s right to defend itself in accordance with international humanitarian law, and discuss the need to take all precautions to minimise civilian casualties, as well as our work to deliver humanitarian assistance,\" Mr Miller told reporters.Israel sent ground forces into Hamas-ruled Gaza late last week after weeks of air and artillery strikes to retaliate for the surprise Hamas attack in which Israel says 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 240 were taken hostage.The Gaza health ministry says at least 8,796 Palestinians in the narrow coastal enclave, including 3,648 children, have been killed by Israeli strikes since Oct 7.Mr Blinken, who as Secretary of State is President Joe Biden\\'s top diplomat, will also discuss options on who will run the densely populated enclave if and when Hamas, an Islamist Palestinian militant group, is defeated.White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday that Washington did not believe Hamas could be involved in governing Gaza when the war is over.In Jordan, Mr Blinken will underscore the importance of protecting civilian lives and reiterate a US commitment to ensure Palestinians are not forcibly displaced out of Gaza, a growing concern of the Arab world, Mr Miller said.He will pursue talks led by Egypt and Qatar on securing the release of more than 200 hostages held by Hamas, Mr Miller said.Turkish diplomatic sources said Blinken would also visit Turkey, but Mr Miller did not confirm the additional stop. \"We will make further announcements as they\\'re available in the coming days,\" he added.Mr Blinken was set to depart Washington on Thursday. His last trip to the region that kicked off on Oct 11 was initially announced as a visit to Israel and Jordan but was later expanded to include five more Arab countries, ending up being his most extensive yet trip to the region. Additional stops were often announced within short notice during the week-long whirlwind journey. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'DUBAI – The heads of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Israel’s Mossad met Qatar’s prime minister in Doha on Nov 28 to build on the two-day extension of a truce between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, a source briefed on the visit said. The meeting was “to build on the progress of the extended humanitarian pause agreement and to initiate further discussions about the next phase of a potential deal”, the source told Reuters.The outcome of the talks, which were also attended by Egyptian officials, was unclear, the source added.Mr David Barnea, the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service, CIA director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani met one day after Qatar announced the two-day extension of an original four-day truce deal in Gaza that had been due to expire overnight.Qatar, where several political leaders of Hamas are based, has been leading negotiations between the Palestinian militant group and Israel.The truce has brought the first respite to the Gaza Strip in seven weeks, during which Israel bombed the territory heavily in response to a violent rampage on Oct 7 by Hamas gunmen who killed around 1,200 people and took 240 captives.Israel has sworn to annihilate Hamas, which rules Gaza. The health authorities in Gaza say Israel’s bombardment of the tiny, densely populated territory has so far killed more than 15,000 people, around 40 per cent of them children.Mr Barnea and Mr Burns were previously in Qatar to meet Sheikh Mohammed on Nov 9.During the first four days of the truce, Hamas fighters released 50 Israeli women and children who had been taken hostage. In return, Israel released 150 security detainees from its jails, all women and teenagers.As part of the two-day truce extension Hamas has agreed to release an additional 10 Israeli women and children each day.So far, there is no indication that Hamas is willing to release any Israeli men or military personnel among those taken captive.

       "  'Title': 'What war crimes laws apply to the Israel-Palestinian conflict?',\n",
       "  'Text': 'THE HAGUE - Conflict between Israel and Palestinian forces since militant group Hamas\\' weekend assault have created a huge and rising death toll on both sides.The war falls under a complex international system of justice that has emerged since World War Two.What laws govern the conflict?Internationally accepted rules of armed conflict emerged out of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which have been ratified by all UN member states and supplemented by rulings at international war crimes tribunals.A series of treaties governs the treatment of civilians, soldiers and prisoners of war in a system collectively known as the \"Law of Armed Conflict\" or \"International Humanitarian Law\". It applies to government forces and organised armed groups, including Hamas militants.If alleged Palestinian perpetrators of atrocities in Israel and all alleged perpetrators of crimes on the occupied Palestinian territories are not brought to justice at home, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is the only international legal organ able to bring charges. Domestic courts can apply so-called universal jurisdiction in war crimes cases, but that would be limited in scope.The ICC\\'s founding Rome Statute gives it legal authority to investigate alleged crimes on the territory of its members or by their nationals, when domestic authorities are \"unwilling or unable\" to do so.On Tuesday, the office of the prosecutor of the ICC confirmed that its mandate applies to potential crimes committed in the current conflict and said it continues to gather information.What is the role of the ICC?The International Criminal Court (ICC), the world\\'s permanent war crimes tribunals, opened in The Hague in 2002. It has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in its 123 member states or committed by its nationals.Many of the world\\'s major powers are not members, including China, the United States, Russia, India and Egypt. The ICC recognises Palestine as a member state, while Israel rejects the court\\'s jurisdiction and does not formally engage with it. With a limited budget and staff, ICC prosecutors are already investigating 17 cases ranging from Ukraine and Afghanistan to Sudan and Myanmar. The ICC budget has allocated less than 100,000 euros ($106,000) for investigations in the Palestinian territories for 2023 and is seeking additional resources.The ICC has had an ongoing investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the occupied Palestinian territories since 2021. It has not issued any arrest warrants.Prosecutors said in 2021 there was a reasonable basis to believe that violations had been committed on all sides, including by Israeli troops, Hamas militants and other armed Palestinian groups.What acts could violate war crimes law?New York-based Human Rights Watch cited as possible war crimes the deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate rocket attacks, and the taking of civilians as hostages by Palestinian armed groups, as well as the Israeli counter-strikes in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians.\"Deliberate killings of civilians, hostage-taking, and collective punishment are heinous crimes that have no justification,\" said Omar Shakir, the group\\'s Israel and Palestine director.The taking of hostages, murder and torture are explicitly banned under the Geneva Conventions, while Israel\\'s response could also be subject to a war crimes investigation. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant drew criticism from U.N. officials and human rights groups by announcing a tightened blockade to prevent food and fuel from reaching the Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million people.Do the Geneva Conventions apply?Israel has a right and duty to respond, US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday, adding that he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had discussed “how democracies like Israel and the United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law.”A siege can be considered a war crime if it targets civilians, rather than a legitimate means to undermine Hamas\\' military capabilities, or if found to be disproportionate.Attacks on military objectives have to be proportional under international law which means they must not lead to excessive loss of civilian life or damage to civilian objects in relation to the direct and concrete military advantage expected.Mr Nick Kaufman, a British-born Israeli defence lawyer at the ICC, cited the gruesome killings by Hamas militants of hundreds of revellers at a dance rave and civilians in several Kibbutz communities near the Gaza border as an obvious focus for a war crimes case.

Israel has said the blast was caused by Palestinian militants.Erdogan said on Wednesday this amounted to \"genocide\", the first time he used that term since the conflict began, but this time he did not name Israel as the perpetrator of the hospital attack.\"The heinous attack against the Al-Ahli al-Arabi Hospital yesterday has brought the massacre in Gaza to another level,\" he said. \"I condemn the perpetrators of this attack, which amounts to a crime against humanity and genocide against the people of Gaza,\" he added.Biden, visiting Israel, said that based on information he had seen the hospital blast appeared to be the result of an errant rocket fired by a \"terrorist group\", echoing Israel\\'s view.

       "  'Text': 'KHAN YOUNIS/TEL AVIV  -     Gazans desperate for an end to their suffering said on Monday they wanted the truce to be extended, while Israelis were divided between those who wanted an extension so all hostages could come home and others worried about giving in to Hamas demands.The truce was due to expire on Monday, and negotiators from Egypt, Qatar and the United States were trying to persuade Hamas and Israel to reach an agreement to prolong it.In Khan Younis, a town in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of people displaced from the north have sought refuge in tents and schools, a large crowd had gathered at a U.N. depot where sacks of flour were being distributed.Sabreen al-Najar said she had waited for several hours to get flour to feed her children, but the ration she had been given was barely enough to last two or three days.\"We want to go back (to our homes). We don\\'t want war at all,\" she said, calling on Arab countries to help Gaza. \"God willing the truce will be extended.\"Al-Najar said her family did not have enough food or clean water, and when it rained they got completely drenched in their makeshift shelter.Other displaced people talked about their difficulties with the cold and rain, the lack of food and power, the daily queues for basic goods, and their longing to return home. All of them wanted the truce to continue.\"What is this four-day truce? This is so unfair, what’s been done to us. What are we going to do in only four days? We’re getting by with candles. We don’t have batteries, gas, electricity, or water. We get water from faraway places,\" said Jumaa al-Araj, a man in a wheelchair.The war began when Hamas militants burst out of Gaza on Oct. 7 and rampaged through southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, including babies and children, and seizing more than 200 hostages.Israel responded with an all-out assault on Gaza which has killed 14,800 Palestinians, four in ten of them children under 18, according to health officials in the Hamas-controlled territory.WIDE RANGE OF VIEWS IN ISRAELOn the other side of the border, Israelis were focused on the fate of the hostages. A total of 58 have been released in three phases since Friday, with more expected to be freed on Monday out of 184 still being held in Gaza.\"We want all hostages back home now, so whatever it takes and as long as we keep on getting them back home, I want the ceasefire to continue,\" said community manager Arava Gerzon Raz, speaking on a square in Tel Aviv that has become a hub for families and supporters of the hostages.Ido Segev, an Intel employee, said he was optimistic the truce would be extended as long as Hamas continued handing over hostages.\"You strike deals when you have some mutual interest and as long as Hamas has an interest to get ceasefire because of military pressure or other reasons they will be paying for that, if you will, with hostages,\" he said.There were, however, dissonant voices who gave a flavour of the wide range of views on the conflict within Israeli society.Adam Sela, who runs a tourism company, said he was against the truce and thought Israel should have held out for a better deal in which all hostages were released.\"I think we\\'re being manoeuvred into a position which is favourable for them (Hamas), and like in all conflicts, if it’s favourable for one side, it’s unfavourable for the other side,\" he said. But Jerusalem resident Anat Errel felt very differently.\"I really hope that it will continue to be ceasefire because violence is not a solution for anything,\" she said, distinguishing between Hamas and civilians in Gaza.\"They (Hamas) need to be punished, but not all the other people in Gaza need to be punished,\" she said.

       "  'Text': 'PARIS – Countries around the world have reacted to a wave of attacks by land, sea and air carried out by Palestinian armed group Hamas that Israel says has claimed hundreds of lives. The statements by world leaders ranged from outright condemnation of the attacks and strong support for Israel from Western nations, to support for Hamas from some Middle Eastern countries. Many have called for a de-escalation of the conflict, after Israel launched air strikes and other military operations targeting Gaza that the Palestinian authorities say have killed hundreds.Here is a round-up of the reactions:United States President Joe Biden said US support for Israel was “rock solid and unwavering”. On Sunday, he ordered US ships and warplanes to move closer to Israel.Washington also promised to provide munitions and equipment to Israel, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on Sunday.Several US citizens were among those killed in Hamas’ surprise attack, according to a US National Security Council spokesperson.Iran President Ebrahim Raisi said on Sunday that Iran supported the Palestinians’ right to self-defence, and warned that Israel must be held accountable for endangering the region.A senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had already backed the attack last Saturday, calling it a “proud operation”.Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry called for “an immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, protection of civilians and self-control”.United Nations The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday, a day after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged diplomatic efforts in the Middle East to prevent wider conflict.Diplomats said the Security Council did not consider any joint statement, let alone a binding resolution, with members led by Russia hoping for a broader focus than condemning Hamas.European Union European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had already condemned the attack by Hamas last Saturday.On Sunday, she posted on X, formerly Twitter: “The full scale of the brutality of the Hamas terror attack leaves us breathless. “Defenceless people, brutally murdered in cold blood on the streets. We stand strong with Israel and its people. Today, the EU and Israeli flags fly side by side.”China “China is deeply concerned about the current escalation of tension and violence between Palestine and Israel,” a Foreign Ministry statement said on Sunday. Beijing “calls on all parties concerned to remain calm and exercise restraint, cease fire immediately, protect civilians and prevent further deterioration of the situation”, it added.Russia Russia’s Foreign Ministry called for an “immediate ceasefire” and negotiations towards “a comprehensive, lasting and long-awaited peace”, said spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is fending off a Russian invasion, said on Sunday that he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to offer condolences “for the numerous casualties caused by the terrorist attack”.He said last Saturday that Israel had an indisputable right to defend itself, adding that “terror is always a crime”.South Africa The ruling African National Congress issued a statement on Sunday saying: “It can no longer be disputed that apartheid South Africa’s history is occupied Palestine’s reality.“As a result, the decision by Palestinians to respond to the brutality of the settler Israeli apartheid regime is unsurprising.”The statement added it was clear that “the degenerating security situation is directly linked to the unlawful Israeli occupation”.France French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna held talks by telephone with several of her counterparts in the Middle East in a bid to “prevent the conflict degenerating” by spreading to other parts of the region, a ministry statement said on Sunday.France’s Foreign Ministry also called for the immediate release of the hostages taken by Hamas.Germany German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sunday that Israel has the right to defend itself against “barbaric attacks” and “to protect its citizens and to pursue the attackers”.He called Mr Netanyahu to tell him Germany stands “firmly and unwaveringly by Israel’s side”. German-Israeli nationals are among the hostages taken by Hamas, a Foreign Ministry source confirmed.Britain British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Sunday he had assured Mr Netanyahu of London’s “steadfast support”.“We will do everything that we can to help. Terrorism will not prevail,” he added in a statement.Turkey Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday urged Israel and Hamas “to support peace” and refrain from harming civilians.“There is no good in (attacking) civilians,” he said. “We are ready to do everything to reduce the tension.”Italy Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called Mr Netanyahu to reaffirm “Rome’s full solidarity” following the Hamas offensive. “Italy stands by the Israeli people at this difficult time,” said a government statement.Japan Japan “strongly condemns” the attacks, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa said on Sunday, as well as the taking of hostages by Hamas.“Meanwhile, we are seriously concerned about the large number of casualties in the Gaza Strip as a result of attacks by the Israel Defence Forces,” her statement continued, calling for restraint.Vatican City Pope Francis on Sunday said that “terrorism and war do not lead to any resolutions, but only to the death and suffering of so many innocent people.“War is a defeat! Every war is a defeat! Let us pray that there be peace in Israel and in Palestine”.India Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India stands “in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour”. “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel,” he said.Venezuela Venezuela’s government expressed its “deep concern” over the clashes.In a statement on X, it said the fighting was “the result of the impossibility of the Palestinian people to find in multilateral international legality a space to assert their historic rights”.Yemen In Yemen, Huthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa expressed their support for “the heroic jihadist operation”. In a statement on the website of the Huthi-controlled Saba news agency, the Iran-aligned militant group said the attack “revealed the weakness, fragility and impotence” of Israel. AFP',\n",

       "  'Text': 'BRUSSELS - European Union (EU) foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Nov 20 that the establishment of a Palestinian state would be the best way of ensuring Israel’s security.Mr Borrell held a video meeting with foreign ministers from the EU’s 27 countries after touring the Middle East for talks on Israel’s war with Hamas.  The EU’s top diplomat said he had drawn “a fundamental political conclusion” from his discussions across the region. “I think that the best guarantee for Israel’s security is the creation of a Palestinian state,” Mr Borrell said in a written summary of the EU meeting.Mr Borrell has insisted Israel should not occupy Gaza after the current conflict ends and that control of the territory should be handed over to the Palestinian Authority.“Despite the huge challenges, we have to advance our reflections on the stabilisation of Gaza and the future Palestinian state,” he said. In the short term, Mr Borrell said, after visiting a string of Arab states, that there was a “sense of urgency” over the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza. “The UN Security Council resolution calling for immediate humanitarian pauses is a big step forward, but we must ensure its rapid implementation,” he said. Another major fear was the possibility of the conflict further inflaming volatile situation in the West Bank and dragging in other actors in the Middle East. “In (the) light of increased extremists and settlers’ violence against Palestinians, there is a real risk that the situation could escalate,” Mr Borrell said. “Reports of a ship hijacked by the Houthis are another worrying signal of a risk of the regional spill over.” AFP',\n",

       "  'Text': 'BRUSSELS - European Union (EU) foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Nov 20 that the establishment of a Palestinian state would be the best way of ensuring Israel’s security.Mr Borrell held a video meeting with foreign ministers from the EU’s 27 countries after touring the Middle East for talks on Israel’s war with Hamas.  The EU’s top diplomat said he had drawn “a fundamental political conclusion” from his discussions across the region. “I think that the best guarantee for Israel’s security is the creation of a Palestinian state,” Mr Borrell said in a written summary of the EU meeting.Mr Borrell has insisted Israel should not occupy Gaza after the current conflict ends and that control of the territory should be handed over to the Palestinian Authority.“Despite the huge challenges, we have to advance our reflections on the stabilisation of Gaza and the future Palestinian state,” he said. In the short term, Mr Borrell said, after visiting a string of Arab states, that there was a “sense of urgency” over the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza. “The UN Security Council resolution calling for immediate humanitarian pauses is a big step forward, but we must ensure its rapid implementation,” he said. Another major fear was the possibility of the conflict further inflaming volatile situation in the West Bank and dragging in other actors in the Middle East. “In (the) light of increased extremists and settlers’ violence against Palestinians, there is a real risk that the situation could escalate,” Mr Borrell said. “Reports of a ship hijacked by the Houthis are another worrying signal of a risk of the regional spill over.” AFP',\n",

       "  'Text': 'PARIS – Countries around the world have reacted to a wave of attacks by land, sea and air carried out by Palestinian armed group Hamas that Israel says has claimed hundreds of lives. The statements by world leaders ranged from outright condemnation of the attacks and strong support for Israel from Western nations, to support for Hamas from some Middle Eastern countries. Many have called for a de-escalation of the conflict, after Israel launched air strikes and other military operations targeting Gaza that the Palestinian authorities say have killed hundreds.Here is a round-up of the reactions:United States President Joe Biden said US support for Israel was “rock solid and unwavering”. On Sunday, he ordered US ships and warplanes to move closer to Israel.Washington also promised to provide munitions and equipment to Israel, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on Sunday.Several US citizens were among those killed in Hamas’ surprise attack, according to a US National Security Council spokesperson.Iran President Ebrahim Raisi said on Sunday that Iran supported the Palestinians’ right to self-defence, and warned that Israel must be held accountable for endangering the region.A senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had already backed the attack last Saturday, calling it a “proud operation”.Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry called for “an immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, protection of civilians and self-control”.United Nations The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday, a day after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged diplomatic efforts in the Middle East to prevent wider conflict.Diplomats said the Security Council did not consider any joint statement, let alone a binding resolution, with members led by Russia hoping for a broader focus than condemning Hamas.European Union European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had already condemned the attack by Hamas last Saturday.On Sunday, she posted on X, formerly Twitter: “The full scale of the brutality of the Hamas terror attack leaves us breathless. “Defenceless people, brutally murdered in cold blood on the streets. We stand strong with Israel and its people. Today, the EU and Israeli flags fly side by side.”China “China is deeply concerned about the current escalation of tension and violence between Palestine and Israel,” a Foreign Ministry statement said on Sunday. Beijing “calls on all parties concerned to remain calm and exercise restraint, cease fire immediately, protect civilians and prevent further deterioration of the situation”, it added.Russia Russia’s Foreign Ministry called for an “immediate ceasefire” and negotiations towards “a comprehensive, lasting and long-awaited peace”, said spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is fending off a Russian invasion, said on Sunday that he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to offer condolences “for the numerous casualties caused by the terrorist attack”.He said last Saturday that Israel had an indisputable right to defend itself, adding that “terror is always a crime”.South Africa The ruling African National Congress issued a statement on Sunday saying: “It can no longer be disputed that apartheid South Africa’s history is occupied Palestine’s reality.“As a result, the decision by Palestinians to respond to the brutality of the settler Israeli apartheid regime is unsurprising.”The statement added it was clear that “the degenerating security situation is directly linked to the unlawful Israeli occupation”.France French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna held talks by telephone with several of her counterparts in the Middle East in a bid to “prevent the conflict degenerating” by spreading to other parts of the region, a ministry statement said on Sunday.France’s Foreign Ministry also called for the immediate release of the hostages taken by Hamas.Germany German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sunday that Israel has the right to defend itself against “barbaric attacks” and “to protect its citizens and to pursue the attackers”.He called Mr Netanyahu to tell him Germany stands “firmly and unwaveringly by Israel’s side”. German-Israeli nationals are among the hostages taken by Hamas, a Foreign Ministry source confirmed.Britain British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Sunday he had assured Mr Netanyahu of London’s “steadfast support”.“We will do everything that we can to help. Terrorism will not prevail,” he added in a statement.Turkey Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday urged Israel and Hamas “to support peace” and refrain from harming civilians.“There is no good in (attacking) civilians,” he said. “We are ready to do everything to reduce the tension.”Italy Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called Mr Netanyahu to reaffirm “Rome’s full solidarity” following the Hamas offensive. “Italy stands by the Israeli people at this difficult time,” said a government statement.Japan Japan “strongly condemns” the attacks, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa said on Sunday, as well as the taking of hostages by Hamas.“Meanwhile, we are seriously concerned about the large number of casualties in the Gaza Strip as a result of attacks by the Israel Defence Forces,” her statement continued, calling for restraint.Vatican City Pope Francis on Sunday said that “terrorism and war do not lead to any resolutions, but only to the death and suffering of so many innocent people.“War is a defeat! Every war is a defeat! Let us pray that there be peace in Israel and in Palestine”.India Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India stands “in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour”. “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel,” he said.Venezuela Venezuela’s government expressed its “deep concern” over the clashes.In a statement on X, it said the fighting was “the result of the impossibility of the Palestinian people to find in multilateral international legality a space to assert their historic rights”.Yemen In Yemen, Huthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa expressed their support for “the heroic jihadist operation”. In a statement on the website of the Huthi-controlled Saba news agency, the Iran-aligned militant group said the attack “revealed the weakness, fragility and impotence” of Israel. AFP',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Palestinian Americans fundraise for Gaza, as aid groups receive record donations',\n",
       "  'Text': 'NEW YORK – Palestinian Americans and aid groups in the United States are raising funds for Gaza, which faces a deepening humanitarian crisis as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth week – but they have as yet limited ability to get supplies into the besieged enclave.Aid organisations that serve civilians in Gaza say they are receiving record amounts of donations in a sign of public support for relief efforts, even as a growing stock of supplies remains stalled at Egypt’s Rafah border crossing.In the Gaza Strip, where 2.3 million people live, civilians are in dire need of clean water, food and medicine, emergency medics say. Half of Gaza’s population was already living in poverty before the crisis.“We’ve seen a significant increase in donations, unlike (anything) we’ve ever seen before,” said Mr Steve Sosebee, president of the US-based Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which has a staff headcount of 40 in Gaza, who provide medical support.He said the fund, which usually has an annual budget of around US$12 million (S$16.45 million), had raised US$15 million in just 10 days.However, with a web of political and logistical obstacles on getting aid in, much of the money and supplies intended for Gaza is in limbo, forcing aid groups to wait as they amass truckloads of goods.Hamas militants burst over the Gaza border and rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people and taking 229 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.In response, Israel launched its most intense air bombardment campaign on the tiny enclave, along with a “total siege”, banning food, water and fuel imports.Aid groups say they are building up supplies in hopes of eventually getting them through to civilians in Gaza, nearly half of whom are children.There has been “a five-fold increase in the total number of donors versus typical past emergencies”, said Mr Derek Madsen, chief development\\xa0officer of Anera, a non-partisan emergency relief group for refugees throughout the Middle East.The organisation, which maintains the privacy of individual donors, said it had recently received the largest single donation from an individual in its 55-year history.The majority of support comes from donors based in the US, he added, with individual donations averaging around US$138. The efforts mirror those of Jewish groups in the US and Canada, who also fundraised millions for Israel.Anera was using the last of its stocks this week to distribute meals and vegetable parcels in Gaza. Its staff of 12, like everyone in Gaza, were facing “unbelievable, unimaginable trauma”, he said.Glued to the televisionIn Ann Arbor, Michigan, Ms Rabia Shafie, national director of the Palestine Aid Society, said her group was speaking to student and Muslim groups on local university campuses and community centres to spread awareness and raise donations for the Red Crescent and UNRWA, the United Nations aid agency that serves Palestinian refugees.“The money is needed to help people survive at this point of time. Medical support is so essential,” she said.“People are glued to the television... watching the news moment to moment, and very stressed out over the situation,” said Ms Rabia, adding that it was difficult as a Palestinian American to watch “the massacre and injustice done to our people back home”.Hamas-governed Gaza is one of the most densely packed places on Earth, and its medical authorities say over 8,000 Palestinians have been killed since air strikes began, including more than 3,000 children.Mr Madsen called for a ceasefire and establishment of a humanitarian corridor “so that people literally do not starve to death, literally do not die of dehydration”.Last week, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, home to one of New York’s largest Muslim and Arab communities, hundreds of protesters called for a ceasefire with signs written in Arabic, Spanish, Hebrew and Korean.In Clifton, New Jersey, the Palestinian American Community Centre’s priorities are calling for US officials to support a ceasefire, and the hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza, said Ms Basma Bsharat, the education director of the centre.The centre has also been collecting cash donations to send on to UNRWA. It has asked people not to donate supplies, which it has no easy way of sending to those in need in Gaza.Last week, a woman came to the centre anyway, hauling bags filled with goods.  “We didn’t know how to say no,” said Ms Basma. “She was like, I just want to do something. I just want to help somehow.”“It’s a very difficult time, and the fact that we do see the support coming in it, it gives some relief,” she said. “It gives some kind of solace.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The nightmare of delivering aid during this Israel-Hamas war',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The 2.3 million people who live in Gaza are facing economic isolation and experiencing incessant bombardment. Their supplies of essential resources, including food and water, are quickly dwindling.In response, US President Joe Biden has pledged US$100 million (S$136 million) in humanitarian assistance for the citizens of Gaza.Mr Biden’s promise raises fundamental questions regarding the delivery of humanitarian aid in a war zone. Political constraints, ethical quandaries and the need to protect the security of aid workers and local communities always make the effort a logistical nightmare.In this specific predicament, US officials have to choose a strategy to deliver the aid without the perception of benefiting Hamas, a group the US and Israel both classify as a terrorist organisation.LogisticsWhen aiding people in war zones, you can’t just send money, a development strategy called “cash transfers” that has become increasingly popular due to its efficiency. Sending money can boost the supply of locally produced goods and services, and help people on the ground pay for what they need most. But injecting cash into an economy so completely cut off from the world would only stoke inflation.So the aid must consist of goods that have to be brought into Gaza, and services provided by people working as part of an aid mission. Humanitarian aid can include food and water; health, sanitation and hygiene supplies and services; and tents and other materials for shelter and settlement.Due to the closure of the border with Israel, aid can arrive in Gaza only via the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border.The US Agency for International Development, or USAid, will likely turn to its long-time partner on the ground, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, to serve as supply depots and distribute goods. That agency, originally founded in 1949 as a temporary measure until a two-state solution could be found, serves in effect as a parallel yet unelected government for Palestinian refugees.USAid will likely want to tap into UNRWA’s network of 284 schools – many of which are now transformed into humanitarian shelters housing two-thirds of the estimated one million people displaced by Israeli air strikes – and 22 hospitals to expedite distribution.PoliticsPrior to the Trump administration, the US was typically the largest single provider of aid to the West Bank and Gaza. USAid administers the lion’s share of it.Since Mr Biden took office, total yearly US assistance for the Palestinian territories has totalled around US$150 million, restored from just US$8 million in 2020 under the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, however, the US was providing more aid to the territories than it is now, with US$1 billion disbursed in the 2013 fiscal year.But the White House needs Congress to approve this assistance – a process that requires the House of Representatives to elect a new Speaker and then for lawmakers to approve aid to Gaza once that happens.EthicsThe UNRWA is a UN organisation. It is not run by Hamas, unlike, for instance, the Gaza Ministry of Health. However, Hamas has frequently undermined UNRWA’s efforts and diverted international aid for military purposes.  Hamas has repeatedly used UNRWA schools as rocket depots. It has repeatedly tunnelled beneath UNRWA schools. It has dismantled European Union-funded water pipes to use as rocket fuselages. And even since the most recent violence broke out, the UNRWA has accused Hamas of stealing fuel and food from its Gaza premises.Humanitarian aid professionals regularly have to contend with these trade-offs when deciding to what extent they can work with governments and local authorities that commit violent acts. They need to do so in exchange for the access required to help civilians under their control.Similarly, Mr Biden has had to make concessions to Israel while brokering for the freedom to send humanitarian aid to Gaza. For example, he has assured Israel that if any of the aid is diverted by Hamas, the operation will cease.This promise may have been politically necessary. But if Mr Biden already believes Hamas to be uncaring about civilian welfare, he may not expect the group to refrain from taking what it can.Security best practicesWhat can be done to protect the security of humanitarian aid operations that take place in the midst of dangerous conflicts?Under international humanitarian law, the local authorities have the primary responsibility for ensuring the delivery of aid – even when they aren’t carrying out that task. To increase the chances that the local authorities will not attack them, aid groups can give “humanitarian notification” and voluntarily alert the local government as to where they will be operating.Hamas has repeatedly flouted international norms and laws. So the question of if and how the aid convoy will be protected looms large.Under the current agreement between the US, Israel and Egypt, the convoy will raise the UN flag. International inspectors will make sure no weapons are on board the vehicles before they cross over from Arish, Egypt, to Rafah, a city located on the Gaza Strip’s border with Egypt.The aid convoy will likely cross without militarised security. This puts it at some danger of diversion once inside Gaza. But whether the aid convoy is attacked, seized or left alone, the Biden administration will have demonstrated its willingness to attempt a humanitarian relief operation. In this sense, a relatively small first convoy bearing water, medical supplies and food, among other items, serves as a test balloon for a sustained operation to follow soon after.If the US were to provide the humanitarian convoy a military escort, by contrast, Hamas could see its presence as a provocation. Washington’s support for Israel is so strong that the US could potentially be judged as a party in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.In that case, the presence of US armed forces might provoke attacks on Gaza-bound aid convoys by Hamas  fighters that otherwise would not have occurred. Combined with the mobilisation of two US Navy carrier groups in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, I’d be concerned that such a move might also stoke regional anger. It would undermine the Biden administration’s attempts to cool the situation.On UN-approved missions, aid delivery may be secured by third-party peacekeepers – meaning, in this case, personnel who are neither Israeli nor Palestinian – with the UN Security Council’s blessing. In this case, tragically, it is unlikely that such a resolution could conceivably pass such a vote, much less quickly enough to make a difference.Topher L.

       "  'Title': 'Scaling up Gaza aid effort faces tangle of challenges',\n",
       "  'Text': 'CAIRO - With a trickle of aid flowing into the besieged Gaza Strip from Egypt, humanitarian staff and diplomats face a web of political, security and logistical obstacles as they try to build up and sustain deliveries of relief.The aid is desperately needed. Supplies of food, water, medicines and fuel have been running critically low for Gaza\\'s 2.3 million people since Israel began its bombardment and \"total siege\" of the Palestinian enclave.Israel’s action is in retaliation for an attack by Hamas militants on Oct 7. But Israel\\'s conditions for inspecting and tracking the aid, security risks transporting and distributing it, and arrangement of its passage through a crossing not used during previous conflicts for large-scale relief efforts have all hampered work to get the operation off the ground.Aid began flowing through Rafah, the main exit and entry point for Gaza that does not border Israel, on Oct 21, with up to 20 trucks crossing daily since. United Nations officials say 100 trucks are required daily to meet essential needs.During past conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, aid had mainly been delivered through crossing points with Israel.The UN aid operation for the Palestinian territories has been run through Israel since the 1950s.Now aid needs to be brought in from Egypt\\'s Sinai Peninsula, an isolated region with a recent history of insurgent attacks and a heavily militarised border. \"It\\'s a huge, huge undertaking to set up a humanitarian operation\\xa0from\\xa0scratch,\" said one aid official who asked not to be named. \"We\\'re not set up like that, not even close, from the\\xa0Egyptian\\xa0side.\"BottlenecksThe aid operation was brokered in talks involving the United States, Israel and Egypt, with a deal to start with a convoy of 20 trucks clinched during a visit by US President Joe Biden to Israel last week, aid officials and diplomats say.As it began, details of an inspection system were still being worked out.Scaling up aid required a quick and light system based on random checks, such as that used for sending aid from Turkey into north-western Syria, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said.Trucks are currently driving more than 40km south along the Egypt-Israel border to be inspected before returning to Gaza.This means a lag of several hours between their entry into the crossing on the Egyptian side and their exit into Gaza. \"There are bottlenecks,\" said Ms Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, which brought some supplies into Gaza with the first convoys but has many more waiting on the Egyptian side of the border.\"What exactly are these bottlenecks? It\\'s very unclear, but I think a lot of it is basically, probably the inspection mechanism and the ability of movement inside Gaza,\" she said.Some Gaza bakeries the WFP works with have been put out of operation because of shortages of fuel, a commodity that has so far not been allowed to cross because of Israeli concerns that it could be used by Hamas.Fuel is also crucial for hospital generators and water supplies, and is fast running out.    US Special Envoy David Satterfield, who has been negotiating with Israel, Egypt and the UN to set up sustained aid deliveries, told MSNBC on Oct 22 that while the critical role of fuel was understood, the provision of food, water and medicine would continue to be the focus \"in the immediate future\".Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.BattlefieldThe US, along with other countries, has also been negotiating to get thousands of foreign passport holders out of Gaza through Rafah.Qatar has meanwhile been leading efforts for the release of hostages taken by Hamas militants during the Oct 7 attack.Two Egyptian security sources linked scaling up of aid to Hamas\\'s willingness to free hostages. From a total of more than 200 hostages, two were freed through Rafah late on Monday, with Hamas crediting Qatar and Egypt for their mediation. Two others were released last week.  The UN says delivery of aid should be unconditional.  On the Gaza side of the border, distribution will depend on the pattern of the conflict and mass displacement of residents, which could be further complicated by an expected Israeli ground operation. As intense bombardment continues, aid organisations have appealed for a humanitarian pause or ceasefire to deliver relief. Security guarantees, especially for northern Gaza where Israeli bombing is concentrated, had not been forthcoming, said Mr Rick Brennan, emergencies director for the World Health Organization. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says 35 of its staff have been killed in Gaza since Oct 7.Bombardment has damaged roads and buildings around Rafah. Not long after Sunday\\'s convoy of trucks entered the crossing, shelling from an Israeli tank hit an Egyptian position nearby, wounding several Egyptian border guards. Israel said the incident was an accident.\"We\\'re going to have to adapt the whole logistics of the operation according to what is transpiring on the battlefield,\" said Mr Griffiths. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Israel PM Netanyahu rejects Gaza ceasefire, says it amounts to ‘surrendering to Hamas’',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday a ceasefire in the Israel’s war against Hamas “will not happen”, as the United Nations warned not enough aid was coming in to meet “unprecedented humanitarian needs”.Israeli ground forces fought inside the Gaza Strip and air strikes pounded the besieged Hamas-run Palestinian territory in response to the Oct 7 attack – the deadliest in Israel’s history.The intensifying military operations have sharply heightened fears for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza, where the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says more than 8,300 have been killed.In a briefing to foreign press, Mr Netanyahu said a ceasefire would amount to surrendering to Hamas, whose gunmen killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages, according to the latest Israeli figures.“Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen,” he said, vowing Israel will “fight until this battle is won”.The United States, Israel’s ally, also objected to a ceasefire.“We do not believe that a ceasefire is the right answer right now,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, adding that “pauses” to get aid into Gaza should be considered instead.As Israeli forces battled Hamas militants inside the narrow Palestinian territory and sent tanks to the outskirts of Gaza City, concern has surged about the widening humanitarian crisis.Mr Kirby said Washington was “confident” of increasing the number of aid trucks to Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt to around 100 a day.Limited aid has entered Gaza from Egypt under a US-brokered deal, but its volume has fallen far short of the hundreds of trucks a day aid agencies say are needed.Mr Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, called for the Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs,” he said.Israeli tanks on Gaza highway The Hamas attack set off the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, marked by weeks of withering aerial bombardment and three continuous nights of ground operations centred on northern Gaza, which Israel has told civilians to evacuate.Columns of Israeli tanks and armoured bulldozers were seen churning through the sand, and snipers took positions inside emptied residential buildings, in footage released by the army.Dozens of tanks advanced for more than an hour into the southern fringes of Gaza City and blocked the main north-south highway, “firing at any vehicle that tries to go on it”, an eyewitness told AFP by phone.Air strikes also cratered the road and brought down buildings, residents said, before the tanks withdrew.The Israeli ground forces were supported by heavy fire from the air and artillery, with the army striking more than 600 targets within 24 hours, up from 450 reported by the military a day earlier.Hamas said it had fired anti-tank missiles at two Israeli armoured vehicles and that “blows delivered by the resistance have prevented” Israeli troops from establishing a presence in Gaza.The Israeli military also said a woman soldier was rescued from captivity after an operation in the Hamas-run territory. The release of Ms Ori Megidish was “secured during a ground operation”, the army said, adding that she had been “medically checked” and was “doing well”.Mr Netanyahu said the international community must demand the captives remaining in Gaza “be freed immediately, unconditionally”.Hamas released a video of what it said were three women hostages, seated against a tile wall, although the time and place of the recording could not be verified.One called in an agitated tone for Mr Netanyahu to agree to Hamas’ proposed exchange of the hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Mr Netanyahu decried the clip as “cruel psychological propaganda”.‘Bombing followed us’ The more than 230 hostages – aged between a few months and above 80 – are believed to be held in a network of underground tunnels where Hamas has hid its military infrastructure from Israeli surveillance and air attacks.Israel confirmed the death of one of those missing – German-Israeli Shani Louk, 23, who was captured by Hamas when its gunmen stormed a desert music festival.Fear and desperation have spiralled in Gaza, under weeks of siege that have cut off water, food, fuel and other essentials.Internet access was severed on Friday but restored on Sunday following US pressure, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.“We made clear to the government of Israel over the weekend that communications networks needed to be restored,” he said on Monday. “It is about ensuring that vital information flows, humanitarian coordination continues and families can stay in touch.”The UN reported on Sunday that “thousands of people” had ransacked aid warehouses in Gaza.Donkey carts were lining up to load water, as safe drinking water has become scarce in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.According to the UN, all 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders – despite sheltering thousands of patients and about 117,000 displaced people.“We were displaced from our homes to the hospital,” Gaza City resident Ashraf al-Muzani, 38, said from Al-Quds hospital where he and his family have sheltered for a week. “The bombing followed us,” he added. “We haven’t been able to sleep and our children are so frightened.”‘Highest’ UN death toll Mr Lazzarini said 64 of his colleagues had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, “the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict in such a short time”.Anti-Israel anger has flared across the region and beyond.In Russia’s Muslim-majority Dagestan, police said they had arrested 60 people after a crowd stormed an airport on Sunday to attack passengers arriving from Tel Aviv.And Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the US of being responsible for what he called “deadly chaos” unfolding in the Middle East.Washington has warned Israel’s enemies – in particular Iran-allied groups – not to become more fully involved after a series of attacks across the region. Israel’s military has struck targets in Syria and traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told AFP he was “doing my duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war”.Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank where health officials say about 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire and in settler attacks since the Gaza war started.

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – As part of efforts to help the victims of the conflict in Gaza, the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) will be sending US$200,000 (S$273,000) worth of relief supplies to the war zone.The SRC said on Tuesday that the relief supplies will include items such as hygiene kits, clean water, food provisions, and medical consumables and equipment such as wheelchairs.The SRC has also deployed a staff member to Cairo, Egypt, to work with the Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC) in identifying immediate and critical needs in Gaza, and to facilitate the delivery of relief supplies in the coming days.The SRC and ERC are working closely to coordinate humanitarian aid into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing – the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.They are also scaling up efforts to provide more humanitarian assistance, the SRC said.Food, water and medical supplies have been coming through the Egyptian border, but the provided aid is simply too small to meet the huge needs on the ground, according to reports.Affected communities in the Gaza Strip have received limited humanitarian aid, said the SRC statement, adding that the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has been working under “challenging conditions” to deliver emergency assistance such as ambulance and healthcare services.“There are severe shortages of essential necessities such as fuel, water and food, while medical supplies are depleting rapidly,” said the SRC.“While some humanitarian aid has arrived in Gaza with support from the ERC and PRCS, it remains inadequate to meet the extensive needs.”SRC chief executive Benjamin William said: “We are deeply concerned about the suffering and anguish experienced by the people in Gaza. Families, children, women and the elderly are enduring unimaginable hardships.”Many victims have to walk long distances to reach safe areas and have no access to basic necessities such as shelter and water, he said.He added that damaged infrastructure and a “communication paralysis” have exacerbated the crisis, leaving victims disconnected from the outside world.“We continue to urge all parties involved to uphold their responsibilities as outlined in international humanitarian law, and prioritise the protection of civilians,” said Mr William, adding that it is important for hospitals, doctors, nurses and humanitarian workers to be protected as well.“It is essential that all parties recognise and enable unhindered critical humanitarian aid into Gaza for all the affected communities, including those who have been displaced.” Two weeks ago, the SRC launched a public fund-raising appeal for relief and recovery operations, which will close on Jan 31, 2024.The organisation earlier pledged US$150,000 to relief efforts, while the Singapore Government contributed $300,000 towards relief operations through the SRC.Members of the public who wish to make an online donation can visit redcross.sg/gazaresponse',\n",

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Singapore has expressed its support for the efforts of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to sustain the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and calls for all innocent civilian lives to be protected, said Singapore’s Ambassador to the UN Burhan Gafoor.“At the outset, I wish to express Singapore’s utmost support for the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to sustain the flow of humanitarian assistance to the civilians affected by this terrible tragedy in Gaza,” said Mr Gafoor.“We commend the Secretary-General for his leadership role in facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance and recognise the important contributions made by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations on the ground,” he noted.He added that Singapore supports all efforts to defuse tensions in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict.“Respect for the UN Charter and for international law has always been a fundamental guiding principle of Singapore’s foreign policy. The UN Charter and international law provide the foundation for international peace and security,” Mr Gafoor said.The ambassador made these comments at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, as Singapore voted in support of a resolution drafted by Arab states calling for an immediate humanitarian truce.The non-binding resolution received 121 votes in favour, while 44 abstained and 14 – including Israel and the United States – voted “no”. Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s retaliatory action has killed more than 7,000 people in Gaza, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry. Mr Gafoor said: “We mourn the loss and suffering of so many innocent civilians, including children and the elderly. This attack (by Hamas) cannot be condoned or justified by any rationale. We condemn this terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms. We also call for the immediate and safe release of all hostages taken by Hamas.“In this regard, it is worth recalling that just in June this year, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,” he noted. This, he said, calls for the international community to reiterate its “strong and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes”.Israel has the legitimate right to defend its citizens and its territory under international law, said Mr Gafoor.However, he also pointed out that Israel also has an obligation to comply with international humanitarian law.\\xa0“All parties must abide by international humanitarian law and do their utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians,” said the ambassador.He added that Singapore welcomes all efforts to establish and uphold safe zones and routes that will keep civilians out of harm’s way and allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. “Singapore is deeply saddened by the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the loss of so many civilian lives. This is a massive humanitarian crisis,” said Mr Gafoor.“We urge all parties involved to allow the rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and essential services to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” he added. To support humanitarian relief operations in Gaza, the Government has made a financial contribution through the Singapore Red Cross, said Mr Gafoor. Many Singaporeans have also made their own contributions to relief operations, he said, noting that it is the Republic’s hope that their contributions will reach those in need quickly. On the resolution, Mr Gafoor said that Singapore has voted in favour after very careful consideration, but added that the Republic deeply regrets that this resolution has “two glaring and significant omissions”. “First, it makes no mention of Hamas’ role in perpetrating the massive and coordinated terror attacks, which led to the brutal killing of 1,400 Israelis and others and the abduction of more than 200 hostages,” he said.“These are acts of terror that we condemn unequivocally, and the abhorrent deeds of Hamas cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever,” said the ambassador, as he reiterated Singapore’s call for the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all civilians taken hostage. “Second, this resolution\\xa0does not acknowledge Israel’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory in compliance with international law. As with every country, Israel has a right to defend itself from heinous terrorist attacks, to protect its people from senseless violence and to keep its territory secure,” he added.Nevertheless, Singapore supported the resolution as the Republic has “always been a consistent advocate and defender of international law, the UN Charter and the rules-based multilateral system”, said Mr Gafoor.\\xa0\\xa0He pointed out that the resolution reaffirms all parties’ obligations to respect and uphold international law, including international humanitarian law. “It expresses strong support for the efforts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and for his calls for the immediate and unrestricted access of humanitarian aid, and to respond to the most basic needs of the Palestinian civilian population amidst the unfolding humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip,” said Mr Gafoor.The resolution, he said, demands that all parties immediately and fully comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law.\\xa0“These obligations have been spelt out in many UN Security Council resolutions. All innocent civilian lives must be protected,” he stressed.On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr Gafoor said that it is a “longstanding one, and it must be resolved in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. He called it the only way to stop the repeated cycles of violence. “Singapore’s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been consistent. We continue to hold the view that the only viable path to a durable, just and comprehensive solution is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” he said. Mr Gafoor also stressed that Singapore calls on leaders from both sides to show leadership, to exercise restraint and to take the difficult but necessary steps towards the vision of a two-state solution.“We support the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland, and Israel’s right to live within secure borders. Both Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, security and dignity,” he added.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Aid supplies to Gaza halted again, UN says starvation imminent   ',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM – United Nations aid deliveries to Gaza were suspended again on Nov 17 due to shortages of fuel and a communications shutdown, deepening the misery of thousands of hungry and homeless Palestinians as Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the enclave. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said civilians faced the “immediate possibility of starvation” due to the lack of food supplies. Palestinian news agency Wafa said a number of Palestinians were killed and others injured in an Israeli strike that hit a group of displaced people near the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt – the transit point for aid. Al Jazeera TV cited sources as saying that nine people were killed in the strike. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the reported strike, and Reuters could not verify it.In other developments, Israel said its troops had found a tunnel shaft used by Hamas at Al-Shifa Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip.The hospital, packed with patients and displaced people and struggling to keep operating, has been a major focus of global concern this week. Israel says Hamas has stored weapons and ammunition and is holding hostages in a network of tunnels under hospitals like Shifa, using patients and people taking shelter there as human shields. Hamas denies this.With the war about to enter its seventh week, there is no sign of any let-up despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.The conflict was triggered by a cross-border raid by Hamas militants on Oct 7 that killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, in the deadliest day in the state’s 75-year-history.More than 11,500 Palestinians, at least 4,700 of them children, have now been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military assault on Hamas-ruled Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry – a toll that far surpasses previous bouts of conflict in recent years.Israel has vowed to wipe out the militant group. Whole neighbourhoods of Gaza have been flattened in air and artillery strikes, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, and the humanitarian situation is catastrophic, aid agencies say.Trucks suspendedThe UN said there would be no cross-border aid operation on Nov 17 due to fuel shortages and a communication shutdown.  For a second consecutive day on Nov 16, no aid lorries arrived in Gaza due to lack of fuel for distributing relief.WFP executive director Cindy McCain said nearly the entire population was in desperate need of food assistance.“Supplies of food and water are practically non-existent in Gaza and only a fraction of what is needed is arriving through the borders,” she said in a statement.“With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,” Ms McCain said.A UN human rights official said Israel must allow water and fuel into Gaza to restart the water supply network.“Every hour that passes with Israel preventing the provision of safe drinking water in the Gaza Strip, in brazen breach of international law, puts Gazans at risk of dying of thirst and diseases,” Mr Pedro Arrojo-Agudo said.The World Health Organisation on Nov 17 said it was very worried about the spread of disease in Gaza, citing more than 70,000 reported cases of acute respiratory infections and over 44,000 cases of diarrhoea, far more than expected.The Israeli military’s chief of staff said Israel was close to destroying Hamas’ military system in the northern Gaza Strip, and there were signs the army was taking its campaign to other parts of the coastal enclave of 2.3 million people.Israel accused Hamas of preventing people from heading to the south of the Gaza Strip, which the militant group denied.The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of Al-Shifa, Gaza’s biggest hospital.The video, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a deep hole in the ground, littered with and surrounded by concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.The army said its troops also found a vehicle in the hospital containing a large number of weapons.Reuters journalists have been unable to reach anyone inside Al-Shifa Hospital for more than 24 hours.Hamas on Nov 16 said claims by the United States that the group uses Shifa for military purposes were “a repetition of a blatantly false narrative, demonstrated by the weak and ridiculous performances of the occupation army spokesman”. Israeli officials said Hamas held some of the 240 hostages taken by gunmen on Oct 7 in the hospital complex.On Nov 17 the Israeli military said soldiers retrieved the body of a female soldier who had been held captive in a building near Shifa.The military confirmed her death on Nov 14 after Hamas issued a video of her alive, followed by images of what it said was her body after she was killed in an Israeli strike.On Nov 16, troops recovered the body of another woman hostage, also in a building near Shifa.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Hamas’ Al-Quds Brigades said they had engaged Israeli forces for several hours in the city of Jenin overnight into Nov 17, unleashing a “torrent of fire” and laying ambushes with explosives.Israel’s military said warplanes struck militants in Jenin who had opened fire on Israeli soldiers. It said at least five of the militants were killed.At least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the Oct 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The violence there has underscored fears that the territory, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, could spiral out of control in tandem with the conflict in Gaza. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'GENEVA – \\xa0The United Nations’ high commissioner for human rights on Tuesday condemned allegations of mass killings and executions by Palestinian armed groups, as he warned that Israel’s announcement of a “complete siege” of Gaza would exacerbate the “already dire” humanitarian situation in the coast.“All parties must respect international humanitarian law,” Mr Volker Turk said in a statement. “They must immediately cease attacks targeting civilians and attacks expected to cause disproportionate death and injury of civilians or damage to civilian objects.”As Israeli warplanes struck hundreds of sites on Monday, Israel’s defence minister said “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed into Gaza, which is controlled by the militant group Hamas and is under a 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt that heavily restricts access for people and goods. Mr Turk said the ability of medical facilities to treat the growing number of people wounded in Israeli strikes would be harmed by a “full siege”.  “The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,” he said. He added that restrictions on people and goods must be “justified by military necessity” or may amount to collective punishment.The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza warned on Sunday of large shortages of medicine and health equipment, as well as fuel required to keep hospital electrical generators running.Mr Turk also said he was “deeply shocked and appalled by allegations of summary executions of civilians, and, in some instances, horrifying mass killings by members of Palestinian armed groups”. He called on Palestinian armed factions to immediately release Israeli civilians who were taken hostage. About 150 people are believed to have been abducted by Palestinian gunmen in the attacks that began on Saturday.“It is horrific and deeply distressing to see images of those captured by Palestinian armed groups being ill-treated, as well as reports of killings and the desecration of their bodies,” he said. “Civilians must never be used as bargaining chips.”The World Health Organisation (WHO) called on Tuesday for a humanitarian corridor to be established into and out of the Gaza.The WHO had reported 13 attacks on health facilities in Gaza since the weekend, and that the organisation’s medical supplies stored there had already been used up.\\xa0“WHO is calling for an end to the violence… A humanitarian corridor is needed to reach people with critical medical supplies,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told journalists in Geneva.“We need supplies to come in: hospitals cannot run without fuel, without electricity.“The supplies that we have pre-positioned are already running low so we need those supplies to come,” Mr Jasarevic said.The United Nations humanitarian office said nearly 200,000 people, or nearly a tenth of the population, have fled their homes in Gaza since the start of hostilities.

       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON - Israel\\'s war Cabinet has agreed to allow 140,000 litres of fuel into Gaza every two days, after a request from Washington, amid acute shortages that threatened aid deliveries and communications in the besieged strip, Israel and US officials said on Friday.Israel imposed a strict blockade on all goods entering Hamas-controlled Gaza when it launched a military campaign in response to the Palestinian militant group\\'s Oct 7 rampage, in which they killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages.Israel has since agreed to allow in aid trucks after stringent inspections, and a small amount of fuel was allowed in on Wednesday to keep United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) aid delivery trucks moving.An Israeli official who declined to be identified said two trucks a day would be allowed in to meet the UN\\'s needs, but said the amount would give \"minimal\" support for water, sewage and sanitary systems in Gaza to prevent pandemics.A US State Department official, offering more details, said Israel had committed to allowing in 120,000 litres of fuel every 48 hours for UNRWA\\'s trucks and other needs like desalinisation of water, sewage pumping, bakeries and hospitals in the south of Gaza.An additional 20,000 litres every two days would be allowed in to power generators of telecoms company Paltel, which had warned of an imminent blackout of its cellphone network due to lack of fuel. US officials have been pushing Israel to allow fuel in for some time. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken made calls to members of Israel\\'s war Cabinet on Wednesday, and warned that the fuel shortage risked a humanitarian catastrophe among Gaza\\'s 2.3 million residents, the State Department official said. Israeli officials had previously argued that Hamas should release hostages before it eased the pressure on Gaza, the official said, adding that negotiations on the release of hostages continue separate from the move on fuel.    The Israeli official confirmed the decision came after a request from Washington, and said allowing the fuel in gives Israel extra room to maneuver in the international arena so it can continue its campaign to eradicate Hamas in Gaza.
