       "  'Title': 'More questions than answers as Israeli PM Netanyahu seeks security control over Gaza',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s declaration this week that Israel would take control of security in Gaza for an indefinite period has added to uncertainty over the future of the besieged enclave, more than a month into the war.Israeli officials have since tried to make clear that they do not intend to reoccupy Gaza, from which Israeli forces withdrew in 2005. But there has been no clarity on how to ensure security without maintaining a military presence in the territory.Only one thing has been stressed repeatedly – Hamas must be destroyed.The movement launched an attack on southern Israel on Oct 7, which Israel says killed 1,400 people. Hamas also took more than 240 hostages.Israel responded to that attack with retaliatory strikes on Gaza, which is ruled by Hamas. Israel’s bombardments have killed more than 10,500 Palestinians.“They cannot be here,” former defence minister Benny Gantz, who joined Mr Netanyahu in an emergency unity government in October, said on Wednesday. “We can come up with any mechanism we think is appropriate, but Hamas will not be part of it.”Mr Gantz, who said Hamas presented an existential threat to Israel, told reporters that Israel would have to ensure “security superiority” around Gaza, but the specifics remain vague in the absence of any coherent idea of the political future.Mr Ron Dermer, one of Mr Netanyahu’s closest aides, who like Mr Gantz is in the inner war Cabinet, said Israel would have to play an active role in the oversight of Gaza.But he said that much would depend on how the enclave was governed in future.“Will there be a force that will prevent terrorism from emerging there? Will there be a Palestinian force that will build and govern Gaza the way it should for the people of Gaza, and not just to destroy Israel? That remains to be seen,” he told US network NBC on Tuesday.The war is already among the bloodiest episodes in decades of conflict.Whole swathes of the densely populated coastal strip have been flattened.More than 1.5 million people, some two-thirds of the population, have been forced from their homes, according to United Nations figures.Rebuilding the physical infrastructure and reconstructing the governance of the area will present a colossal challenge which will force Israel to work with the Palestinians, diplomats say, despite the bitter enmity on both sides.As the war continues, there have been calls from Western countries, including the United States, for a renewal of stalled efforts to agree on a two-state solution, with an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a news conference in Tokyo: “Now, the reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict, but it is imperative that Palestinian people (be) central to governance in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.“It is also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza.”Challenges aheadIsrael originally withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, drawing the wrath of hardline settlers who were forced to leave with the army when former prime minister Ariel Sharon decided the costs of maintaining a presence were too high.The challenges that are likely to confront any reshaped Israeli security mechanism have already been clearly demonstrated during more than 18 months of increasingly violent clashes in the nearby occupied West Bank.Some diplomats have mooted the possibility of a reshaped Palestinian Authority (PA) playing a role in the administration of Gaza, if Israel succeeds in its aim of dismantling Hamas.The PA used to run both Gaza and the West Bank, but was forcibly ousted from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. It now governs only sections of the West Bank, which is dotted with ever-growing Jewish settlements. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh recently told foreign reporters that the PA would not return to Gaza “on the back of an Israeli tank”.Those comments threw serious doubt on speculation that Israel will seek to offload responsibility for the day-to-day running of the enclave onto its previous masters. In any case, the PA has long struggled to impose its authority even in the West Bank. In theory, it is responsible for order in the area, but it is mistrusted by both Israel and large sections of the Palestinian population. In its place, the Israeli army has largely taken the job of combating militant activity.Over the past 18 months, Israeli troops have killed hundreds of Palestinians – hardened militant fighters, stone-throwing young people and uninvolved civilians – and made thousands of arrests across the West Bank. In the same period, dozens of Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians.Cities such as Nablus and Jenin, which earlier in 2023 was the scene of a two-day battle involving hundreds of Israeli troops backed by drones and helicopter gunships, have become strongholds for militant groups including Hamas.Mr Dermer said that while Israeli troops had physically entered West Bank towns, they had essentially been absent from Gaza for the last 17 years.  “Obviously, we can’t repeat (this). So, after Hamas is removed from power... Israel is going to have to retain over-riding security responsibility indefinitely.”Jordan’s former deputy prime minister, Mr Marwan Muasher, told Reuters he had seen no convincing initiative on how Gaza might be governed once the conflict ended.“I don’t think that there is any clear thinking yet about what to do with the day after,” said Mr Muasher, who is vice-president for studies at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

       "  'Text': 'US President Joe Biden has warned Israel that occupying Gaza “would be a big mistake”. The warning seemed to be aimed directly at voices within the Israeli government who are calling for Israel to not only destroy Hamas, but also to occupy the Palestinian territory.Mr Biden\\xa0supports Israel’s right to defend itself\\xa0and to destroy Hamas’ military capabilities. But, if history is anything to go by, then occupation – as a strategy to destroy Hamas – seems doomed to fail. The Gaza Strip\\xa0was under Israeli military occupation following the June 1967 war (it was earlier occupied by Egypt) until Israel unilaterally withdrew from the territory\\xa0in 2005. This included the removal of 21 settlements comprising 8,500 Israeli civilians who were living amid 1.4 million Palestinians. The realities of occupationThe occupation of Gaza required the diversion of significant military and economic resources to protect the settlers in a land with which most Israelis did not feel a sense of kinship. Polls\\xa0from 2004\\xa0and\\xa02005\\xa0of Israeli public opinion showed that between 53 per cent and 60 per cent supported the disengagement plan.Indeed, the recent Hamas attacks are a painful reminder of the occupation’s costs. In response to rising tensions in recent weeks in the West Bank and East Jerusalem (both occupied by Israel since 1967 and previously under Jordanian occupation), the Israeli army diverted its entire Gaza division to protect Israeli settlers in the West Bank and to prevent a deadly escalation there over the Jewish holidays. This left the Israeli military significantly under-equipped and under-manned to respond immediately and decisively to the Hamas attacks from Gaza.Already burdened by policing missions around Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and with the ever-present threat of a military confrontation with Hezbollah (the Iranian-backed Shi’ite militia group established in the early 1980s) along its northern border, the notion of a military reoccupation of Gaza by Israel would probably see its resources stretched not only beyond capacity, but also beyond its long-term interests.The Israeli government’s stated aims for its current operation have so far been vague. “Destroying Hamas’ military capabilities” may mean different things to different people – from the precise targeting of its arms and the killing of its military leaders, to destroying Hamas as an idea.What occupation cannot solveMilitary occupation is unlikely to kill the violent Hamas ideology. Indeed, it was the first Palestinian popular uprising (intifada) against the Israeli occupation in the West Bank which gave rise to\\xa0Hamas in 1987, as a younger, Islamist alternative to the Fatah leadership. Fatah, the dominant faction of the Palestinian Authority (PA) which administers the Palestinian areas in the West Bank, is a secular, nationalist party that recognises Israel – whereas Hamas does not.So any sustained military occupation of Gaza is likely to garner more support for Hamas, rather than eradicate it. It is also unlikely that the PA in the West Bank would be eager to fill the power vacuum which would be created in the unlikely event that Israel successfully eradicates Hamas altogether, for fear of being depicted as Israeli collaborators by the Palestinian people. Moreover, an occupation brings with it the responsibility of administering the daily lives of 2.3 million Palestinians. This is something that neither Israel nor the PA wants or can do in the current circumstances.Lessons from 1982Israeli leaders should also take lessons from the last time the country tried to eradicate a terrorist group and impose regime change.In 1982, the Israeli military invaded southern Lebanon to remove the threat of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) to its northern towns. It ended with a failed alliance with the Christian Phalange party in Lebanon, which directly led to the\\xa0Sabra and Shatila massacre\\xa0and an 18-year Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, ending with a\\xa0“chaotic” withdrawal in 2000. None of Israel’s options to achieve its aim of destroying Hamas’ military capabilities is easy. Relying solely on air strikes will lead to a large number of civilian casualties, and is unlikely to destroy\\xa0Hamas’ tunnels\\xa0or kill its military leaders.A ground operation will not only lead to a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented proportions, but is also likely to start a creeping, short-term occupation leading to a permanent occupation – as the history of the June 1967 and 1982 Lebanon wars shows.Since its military and civilian withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, and following Hamas’ takeover of the territory from Fatah in 2007, Israel has blockaded the strip for security reasons by air, land and sea, effectively controlling who and what is allowed to enter and leave. Egypt has similarly blockaded the southern border of the Gaza Strip by Rafah.While Israel no longer occupies Gaza – inasmuch as it is not responsible for the daily lives of Gazans – the continuous blockade has significantly contributed to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the strip. That Hamas has proven to be a more capable terrorist organisation than an effective government has only set the Palestinian quest for freedom and statehood back even further.Asaf Siniver is professor of international security, University of Birmingham.

       "  'Title': 'Israeli army to confront resilient foe in anticipated Gaza invasion',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM – An Israeli invasion of Gaza will face an enemy that has built a formidable armoury with Iran’s help, dug a vast tunnel network to evade attackers and has shown in past ground wars it can exact a heavier toll on Israeli troops each time.Israel has massed tanks on Gaza’s border and ministers have suggested the start of an invasion is a matter of when, not if.Israel’s generals will look to lessons learned from past ground offensives in 2008 and 2014 that also aimed to smash the Palestinian militant group Hamas, an Israeli security source and experts said.Yet Hamas has till now emerged a tougher opponent each time. On Oct 7, it staged its most devastating display when its fighters killed more than 1,300 Israelis.It was the deadliest attack on Israeli soil since its founding in 1948.Israeli air strikes in response have killed more than 1,400 people in Gaza so far.Neither side can know exactly what to expect in a ground war. Israel has promised a campaign exceeding anything ever launched to wipe Hamas “off the face of the earth”.Hamas has shown its ability to survive and surprise, and will be fighting in a dense urban setting with powerful weapons.“A ground incursion will be like diving into the unknown by the occupation and its forces,” an official in one of Gaza’s Palestinian militant factions told Reuters, giving only his nickname of Abu Abdallah.Israeli officials have made clear it will not be a swift or easy campaign. And this time, it faces the problem of scores of Israeli hostages seized by Hamas on Oct 7.The hostages could now be held in the warren of tunnels that Israeli troops call the “Gaza Metro”, and which soldiers must clear to destroy Hamas.“The purpose is to defeat the entire military capabilities and military apparatus of Hamas, and that will demand a long operation,” an Israeli security source told Reuters.“Most of the targets, people, equipment, logistics are located underground and it’s possible the hostages are located underground,” the source said. “The purpose will be to flatten the ground to then be able to get to the underground bunkers.”In Gaza, a strip of land with 2.3 million people, the risk of a mounting civilian death toll could also complicate Israel’s military plans.Levelling the landBased on experience, Israel’s bunker buster bombs and high-tech Merkava tanks will be up against booby-trapped tunnels, fighters using the underground network to strike and vanish, and a range of Hamas weaponry that includes Russian-made Kornet anti-tank missiles that Israel first reported used in 2010.Hundreds of thousands of reservists are being mobilised by Israel for combat against fighters who, one former official in Israel’s Shin Bet security service said, could number 20,000.Hamas spokespeople have declined to comment to Reuters about any military operations or planning.Mr Saleh Al-Arouri, deputy chief of the Hamas politburo, told Al Jazeera that before Hamas unleashed its assault on Israel, it had a defence plan that was stronger than its attack plan.Israeli officials have not discussed any military details. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said they were “preparing for a ground offensive”, and the goal was to heavily damage “terrorist infrastructure” so it was no longer a threat to Israel.But Gaza residents have already spotted what they believe to be invasion preparations in the intense Israeli bombardment of the enclave since the initial assault by Hamas. Residents say bombing has levelled corridors of land along the border that could open the way for ground forces.But Palestinian militant official Abu Abdallah said Gaza’s fighters were ready.“Planes do not determine a battle. Many fighters would prefer to face tanks and forces on the ground, armed by the developed capabilities built up over years,” he said.Since 2007, when Hamas took control of Gaza from the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, Israel has launched two major land incursions. Each time it suffered a higher death toll of soldiers – nine killed in 2008 and 66 in 2014.This time, Hamas has had longer to prepare, making no secret of support coming from Iran, Israel’s arch regional foe.Learning lessonsMore recently than its Gaza incursions, Israeli troops were confronted with the growing capability of militants in a West Bank clash in June. In a raid on Jenin refugee camp, a militant hotbed, Israeli soldiers were ambushed and pinned down. Apache helicopter support was called in to help.“The difference between what is happening in Gaza compared to the battle of Jenin camp is between heaven and earth,” said a member of the Jenin Brigade. “We do not have military barracks or heavy weapons such as rockets and Kornets.”A former senior Israeli commander, who asked not to be identified, said confrontations like Jenin still offered lessons as the military prepared for a Gaza incursion.“You will have to look at Gaza (as having) much more high capacities and with highly developed technology all over,” he said.Israel’s government, which under Prime Minister Netanyahu had been one of the most hard-right in its history but now includes opposition figures to build national unity, has said the public must prepare for a long conflict to reach its goal.“We started the offensive from the air, later on we will also come from the ground,” Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told soldiers near the border fence on Tuesday, one of the strongest signals that an invasion will go ahead.Mr Shalom Ben Hanan, a former top official in Israel’s Shin Bet security service and now a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism at Israel’s Reichman University, said a ground offensive was the only way to dismantle Hamas.“There is no sterile war. We will suffer casualties,” he said. “We are going to fight, to make combat with very experienced and trained fighters.”“It must be a decisive win.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The nightmare of delivering aid during this Israel-Hamas war',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The 2.3 million people who live in Gaza are facing economic isolation and experiencing incessant bombardment. Their supplies of essential resources, including food and water, are quickly dwindling.In response, US President Joe Biden has pledged US$100 million (S$136 million) in humanitarian assistance for the citizens of Gaza.Mr Biden’s promise raises fundamental questions regarding the delivery of humanitarian aid in a war zone. Political constraints, ethical quandaries and the need to protect the security of aid workers and local communities always make the effort a logistical nightmare.In this specific predicament, US officials have to choose a strategy to deliver the aid without the perception of benefiting Hamas, a group the US and Israel both classify as a terrorist organisation.LogisticsWhen aiding people in war zones, you can’t just send money, a development strategy called “cash transfers” that has become increasingly popular due to its efficiency. Sending money can boost the supply of locally produced goods and services, and help people on the ground pay for what they need most. But injecting cash into an economy so completely cut off from the world would only stoke inflation.So the aid must consist of goods that have to be brought into Gaza, and services provided by people working as part of an aid mission. Humanitarian aid can include food and water; health, sanitation and hygiene supplies and services; and tents and other materials for shelter and settlement.Due to the closure of the border with Israel, aid can arrive in Gaza only via the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border.The US Agency for International Development, or USAid, will likely turn to its long-time partner on the ground, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, to serve as supply depots and distribute goods. That agency, originally founded in 1949 as a temporary measure until a two-state solution could be found, serves in effect as a parallel yet unelected government for Palestinian refugees.USAid will likely want to tap into UNRWA’s network of 284 schools – many of which are now transformed into humanitarian shelters housing two-thirds of the estimated one million people displaced by Israeli air strikes – and 22 hospitals to expedite distribution.PoliticsPrior to the Trump administration, the US was typically the largest single provider of aid to the West Bank and Gaza. USAid administers the lion’s share of it.Since Mr Biden took office, total yearly US assistance for the Palestinian territories has totalled around US$150 million, restored from just US$8 million in 2020 under the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, however, the US was providing more aid to the territories than it is now, with US$1 billion disbursed in the 2013 fiscal year.But the White House needs Congress to approve this assistance – a process that requires the House of Representatives to elect a new Speaker and then for lawmakers to approve aid to Gaza once that happens.EthicsThe UNRWA is a UN organisation. It is not run by Hamas, unlike, for instance, the Gaza Ministry of Health. However, Hamas has frequently undermined UNRWA’s efforts and diverted international aid for military purposes.  Hamas has repeatedly used UNRWA schools as rocket depots. It has repeatedly tunnelled beneath UNRWA schools. It has dismantled European Union-funded water pipes to use as rocket fuselages. And even since the most recent violence broke out, the UNRWA has accused Hamas of stealing fuel and food from its Gaza premises.Humanitarian aid professionals regularly have to contend with these trade-offs when deciding to what extent they can work with governments and local authorities that commit violent acts. They need to do so in exchange for the access required to help civilians under their control.Similarly, Mr Biden has had to make concessions to Israel while brokering for the freedom to send humanitarian aid to Gaza. For example, he has assured Israel that if any of the aid is diverted by Hamas, the operation will cease.This promise may have been politically necessary. But if Mr Biden already believes Hamas to be uncaring about civilian welfare, he may not expect the group to refrain from taking what it can.Security best practicesWhat can be done to protect the security of humanitarian aid operations that take place in the midst of dangerous conflicts?Under international humanitarian law, the local authorities have the primary responsibility for ensuring the delivery of aid – even when they aren’t carrying out that task. To increase the chances that the local authorities will not attack them, aid groups can give “humanitarian notification” and voluntarily alert the local government as to where they will be operating.Hamas has repeatedly flouted international norms and laws. So the question of if and how the aid convoy will be protected looms large.Under the current agreement between the US, Israel and Egypt, the convoy will raise the UN flag. International inspectors will make sure no weapons are on board the vehicles before they cross over from Arish, Egypt, to Rafah, a city located on the Gaza Strip’s border with Egypt.The aid convoy will likely cross without militarised security. This puts it at some danger of diversion once inside Gaza. But whether the aid convoy is attacked, seized or left alone, the Biden administration will have demonstrated its willingness to attempt a humanitarian relief operation. In this sense, a relatively small first convoy bearing water, medical supplies and food, among other items, serves as a test balloon for a sustained operation to follow soon after.If the US were to provide the humanitarian convoy a military escort, by contrast, Hamas could see its presence as a provocation. Washington’s support for Israel is so strong that the US could potentially be judged as a party in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.In that case, the presence of US armed forces might provoke attacks on Gaza-bound aid convoys by Hamas  fighters that otherwise would not have occurred. Combined with the mobilisation of two US Navy carrier groups in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, I’d be concerned that such a move might also stoke regional anger. It would undermine the Biden administration’s attempts to cool the situation.On UN-approved missions, aid delivery may be secured by third-party peacekeepers – meaning, in this case, personnel who are neither Israeli nor Palestinian – with the UN Security Council’s blessing. In this case, tragically, it is unlikely that such a resolution could conceivably pass such a vote, much less quickly enough to make a difference.Topher L.

       "  'Title': 'What links Hamas to the Axis of Resistance and its patron Iran? ',\n",
       "  'Text': 'In the decades-long regional hostility between Israel and Iran, Palestinian militant group Hamas has never come fully under the Islamic republic’s sway.It has in recent years taken money from Qatar, learnt propaganda lessons from ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria), and kept up relations with Egyptian intelligence.But last Saturday’s multi-pronged assault on Israel, cheered on by Iran, has prompted a reassessment of how deep the ties have grown between Hamas and Teheran. For Israel and regional powers, the main question is whether Teheran-backed groups that pose an existential threat to Israel – the so-called Axis of Resistance – provide an explanation for how Hamas developed the capacity to mount such an audacious attack.“The Axis of Resistance... aims to annihilate and wipe out Israel from existence,” said Mr Abdul Majeed Awad, head of Hamas’ political and media relations office in Lebanon. Other allies had not been informed of the operation until after it was under way, but Iran and its most important proxy, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, had been “following every moment” of the assault, Mr Awad said.Iran has in recent years worked hard to strengthen ties with Palestinian militant groups, according to Israeli officials, portraying itself as the champion of their cause at a time when several Arab states have been moving to normalise relations with the Jewish state.Israel’s assessment is that Teheran has made a push to move money, arms – and even drugs – into the occupied West Bank via Jordan as part of its efforts to foment attacks by Palestinian militants against Israeli targets.“Iran views the Palestinian arena as a major opportunity to promote its vision of surrounding Israel with a ‘ring of fire’... heavily armed terror armies that can activate firepower and cross-border raids against Israel, under Iranian influence,” said Israel-based defence analyst Yaakov Lappin. “This is part of Iran’s goal of challenging Israel from within and on its borders.”Predominantly Shi’ite, Iran already has a proxy in Gaza in Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a smaller group that sometimes rivals Hamas, and sometimes fights alongside it. But bringing the larger and more established Hamas, which controls Gaza, more fully into its orbit would be a coup.Hamas is “not in Iran’s pocket. It has a multitude of relations, with Qatar and Turkey among others,” said Dr Mohanad Hage Ali, a Beirut-based senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East think-tank. “This new alliance with Iran, however important it is, only stands if it’s reciprocated and if it will back up Hamas.”Israel has estimated that the PIJ, which also claimed to have taken part in Saturday’s assault, and Hamas receive US$100 million (S$137 million) a year between them from Iran. Teheran has also provided training for fighters, and expertise in how to improve its production of rockets to make them more lethal and accurate.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, said of the attack on Israel: “God willing, the cancer of the usurper Zionist regime will be eradicated at the hands of the Palestinian people and the resistance forces throughout the region.”Yet Hamas – a Sunni Islamist movement formed in the 1980s around the time of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising – has always maintained a strategic ambiguity to maintain the maximum support for its cause. “All who oppose the Zionist regime are our friends – the Palestinian cause is universal,” Mr Ahmed Yousef, a senior adviser to Hamas leaders, told the Financial Times last year.Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war across the Middle East – in the likes of Syria, Lebanon and Iraq – with rocket and drone strikes as well as assassinations. Iran harasses Israel from the north via Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from the north-east, where Iranian and Hezbollah fighters have free rein along the Syrian border. In 2021, Israel and Iran were involved in tit-for-tat naval sorties that involved both civilian and quasi-military vessels in the Mediterranean.The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Iranian security officials “helped plan” Saturday’s surprise attack, a report that was denied by Iran and its proxies. “We emphatically stand in unflinching support of Palestine; however, we are not involved in Palestine’s response, as it is taken solely by Palestine itself,” Iran’s United Nations mission said.A senior Israeli military official said that while his view was that the “Iranians are involved”, he cautioned not to overstate Teheran’s role.Mr Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official, said Iran’s goal in building up groups such as Hamas and PIJ in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and various Shi’ite militias in Syria was to “destroy the State of Israel... We have to ask ourselves if the war Hamas has started is the beginning of a multi-front assault.”Despite the Hamas offensive being long in the planning – Israeli analysts contend it probably took months, if not a year, to develop – the timing may have been linked to Iranian and Hamas fears over the growing prospects of an Israel-Saudi Arabia normalisation deal.Mr Khamenei also recently warned that it was a “mistake” to bet on “normalisation with the Zionist regime”, while Iran’s Foreign Ministry has described the Hamas invasion as “spontaneous”.One incident that points to increased cooperation between Israel’s foes was a visit to Lebanon in April by Mr Ismail Haniyeh, a top Hamas leader, to meet Palestinian factions inside Lebanon. He asked them to “unite and escalate”.Other members of Hamas’ leadership visit Iran and regularly meet Hezbollah, while some Hamas leaders have moved to Lebanon.The increased presence of Hamas’ leadership in Lebanon meant Hezbollah and Lebanon were “tied to inter-Palestinian tensions and to violence against Israel’s occupation”, Dr Hage Ali said, adding that this dalliance could lead to broader regional conflict.In a sign of the widening struggle, Israel shelled southern Lebanon on Monday, prompted by a cross-border raid by the PIJ. The Israeli military said soldiers, backed by helicopters, killed at least two gunmen who had crossed the border.Dr Hage Ali continued: “If Hamas is in existential danger with an Israeli revenge attack and ground invasion, what good is this alliance if the conflict wouldn’t widen to include attacks on other fronts?” FINANCIAL TIMES',\n",

       "  'Text': 'PARIS – Countries around the world have reacted to a wave of attacks by land, sea and air carried out by Palestinian armed group Hamas that Israel says has claimed hundreds of lives. The statements by world leaders ranged from outright condemnation of the attacks and strong support for Israel from Western nations, to support for Hamas from some Middle Eastern countries. Many have called for a de-escalation of the conflict, after Israel launched air strikes and other military operations targeting Gaza that the Palestinian authorities say have killed hundreds.Here is a round-up of the reactions:United States President Joe Biden said US support for Israel was “rock solid and unwavering”. On Sunday, he ordered US ships and warplanes to move closer to Israel.Washington also promised to provide munitions and equipment to Israel, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on Sunday.Several US citizens were among those killed in Hamas’ surprise attack, according to a US National Security Council spokesperson.Iran President Ebrahim Raisi said on Sunday that Iran supported the Palestinians’ right to self-defence, and warned that Israel must be held accountable for endangering the region.A senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had already backed the attack last Saturday, calling it a “proud operation”.Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry called for “an immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, protection of civilians and self-control”.United Nations The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday, a day after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged diplomatic efforts in the Middle East to prevent wider conflict.Diplomats said the Security Council did not consider any joint statement, let alone a binding resolution, with members led by Russia hoping for a broader focus than condemning Hamas.European Union European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had already condemned the attack by Hamas last Saturday.On Sunday, she posted on X, formerly Twitter: “The full scale of the brutality of the Hamas terror attack leaves us breathless. “Defenceless people, brutally murdered in cold blood on the streets. We stand strong with Israel and its people. Today, the EU and Israeli flags fly side by side.”China “China is deeply concerned about the current escalation of tension and violence between Palestine and Israel,” a Foreign Ministry statement said on Sunday. Beijing “calls on all parties concerned to remain calm and exercise restraint, cease fire immediately, protect civilians and prevent further deterioration of the situation”, it added.Russia Russia’s Foreign Ministry called for an “immediate ceasefire” and negotiations towards “a comprehensive, lasting and long-awaited peace”, said spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is fending off a Russian invasion, said on Sunday that he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to offer condolences “for the numerous casualties caused by the terrorist attack”.He said last Saturday that Israel had an indisputable right to defend itself, adding that “terror is always a crime”.South Africa The ruling African National Congress issued a statement on Sunday saying: “It can no longer be disputed that apartheid South Africa’s history is occupied Palestine’s reality.“As a result, the decision by Palestinians to respond to the brutality of the settler Israeli apartheid regime is unsurprising.”The statement added it was clear that “the degenerating security situation is directly linked to the unlawful Israeli occupation”.France French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna held talks by telephone with several of her counterparts in the Middle East in a bid to “prevent the conflict degenerating” by spreading to other parts of the region, a ministry statement said on Sunday.France’s Foreign Ministry also called for the immediate release of the hostages taken by Hamas.Germany German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sunday that Israel has the right to defend itself against “barbaric attacks” and “to protect its citizens and to pursue the attackers”.He called Mr Netanyahu to tell him Germany stands “firmly and unwaveringly by Israel’s side”. German-Israeli nationals are among the hostages taken by Hamas, a Foreign Ministry source confirmed.Britain British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Sunday he had assured Mr Netanyahu of London’s “steadfast support”.“We will do everything that we can to help. Terrorism will not prevail,” he added in a statement.Turkey Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday urged Israel and Hamas “to support peace” and refrain from harming civilians.“There is no good in (attacking) civilians,” he said. “We are ready to do everything to reduce the tension.”Italy Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called Mr Netanyahu to reaffirm “Rome’s full solidarity” following the Hamas offensive. “Italy stands by the Israeli people at this difficult time,” said a government statement.Japan Japan “strongly condemns” the attacks, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa said on Sunday, as well as the taking of hostages by Hamas.“Meanwhile, we are seriously concerned about the large number of casualties in the Gaza Strip as a result of attacks by the Israel Defence Forces,” her statement continued, calling for restraint.Vatican City Pope Francis on Sunday said that “terrorism and war do not lead to any resolutions, but only to the death and suffering of so many innocent people.“War is a defeat! Every war is a defeat! Let us pray that there be peace in Israel and in Palestine”.India Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India stands “in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour”. “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel,” he said.Venezuela Venezuela’s government expressed its “deep concern” over the clashes.In a statement on X, it said the fighting was “the result of the impossibility of the Palestinian people to find in multilateral international legality a space to assert their historic rights”.Yemen In Yemen, Huthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa expressed their support for “the heroic jihadist operation”. In a statement on the website of the Huthi-controlled Saba news agency, the Iran-aligned militant group said the attack “revealed the weakness, fragility and impotence” of Israel. AFP',\n",

       "  'Title': 'I negotiated Israel’s hardest hostage deal. Here’s what’s next in Gaza',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit had been a hostage for five years before Israel and Hamas were seriously willing to work towards his release. That was 2011. I had been pursuing secret back-channel communications with Hamas since a week after he was captured in a cross-border raid and dragged into Gaza. My partner in these secret negotiations was Mr Ghazi Hamad, Hamas’ spokesman who was then also a political adviser to its prime minister.Mr Hamad showed compassion for Mr Shalit and his family many times. In the end, the price of Mr Shalit’s freedom was steep: 1,027 Palestinian prisoners. On Oct 18, 2011, he returned to his home in northern Israel. When I talked to Mr Hamad on the phone early that morning, he blurted out in a moment of spontaneous joy: “Next time we will negotiate peace!”On the first night of Israel’s bombing, I have learnt, Mr Hamad’s home in Gaza City was destroyed in an air strike. I saw it as a clear signal from Israel: Everyone affiliated with Hamas is a target. The time for talk is over.Today, there are again hostages in Gaza – more than 200, according to the Israeli government. On Friday, Hamas released two of them – an American mother and daughter – but the fate of the others remains unclear.As deadly air strikes on Gaza continue and Israel amasses troops at the border in preparation for a ground invasion, their safety grows more precarious each day. Should Israel negotiate to get its civilian hostages out of Gaza as quickly as possible? Should it sacrifice them to achieve its goal going into this war – to eliminate Hamas? Should it exchange them for prisoners, as it has done in the past?Old rules no longer applyThese considerations present a stark dilemma for all Israelis, but perhaps none more so than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was once the staunchest opponent of negotiating with terrorists of any kind, but who also came to realise that the ethos of leaving no soldier behind did sometimes require that kind of engagement. Israelis have been held hostage many times over the nation’s 75 years. In May 1974, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine held 115 hostages, most of them high school students in the town of Maalot, in northern Israel, for two days, an episode that ended in the murders of 22 hostages. Air Force officer Ron Arad was shot down over Lebanon in 1986 and was never returned. In May 1985, Israel released 1,150 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the return of three Israeli soldiers captured in Lebanon. Over the course of those painful episodes, the nation learnt a great deal about how to work for its hostages’ release, whether through third-party negotiations, secret back channels or force. But today’s hostage crisis is unlike any other. It’s not just a few people being held by hostile forces. It’s about 200 people, including women, children and the elderly, and it’s unfolding in the midst of a full-blown war. None of the old rules apply. Hamas held Mr Shalit in a secret location. Is that possible with such a large group? Gaza is a very small territory with a very dense population, not all of whom support Hamas. The inevitable intelligence leaks could enable Israel to conduct rescue operations. Israeli intelligence analysts will be looking for leads anywhere they can find them, such as data from cellphones found on the bodies of terrorists killed since the attack on Oct 7.It is equally unclear how this group of hostages will be treated. Hamas treated Mr Shalit surprisingly well during his years of captivity. He was never physically tortured. Could the same be the case with so many hostages? Hamas has said that some of them are being held by other groups, including Islamic Jihad. Whatever Hamas’ approach is towards these hostages, there is no guarantee that another group will share it.Killing hostages is not what I would previously have expected from Hamas. But the killing spree of Oct 7, including the butchering of whole families, the burning of homes, the destruction of whole communities, changed that. On Monday, it released a video of a 21-year-old hostage who appeared to have been wounded and was being treated on camera. There were no signs that she had been tortured, but it was clear that she was under duress.Negotiating for the release of hostages may also be less popular this time around. The Shalit deal was very difficult for Israel to accept. More than 300 of the Palestinians who were released from prison had been serving life sentences for violent acts, including killing Israelis. It was hard for me, too: My wife’s first cousin Sasson Nuriel was kidnapped and killed by Hamas in September 2005. Four of the people responsible for murdering him were released as part of the agreement that I negotiated. Still, in the end, nearly 80 per cent of the public, according to one poll, along with 26 government ministers and the entire national security establishment, supported the deal. Prime Minister Netanyahu signed off on the agreement.Today, Israel holds about 7,000 Palestinian prisoners, of whom 559 are serving life sentences for killing Israelis, according to Addameer, a Palestinian prisoners’ rights group. Will Israelis, still reeling from the atrocities of Oct 7, be willing to accept this kind of bargain again? Is it safe to do so?One of the men who killed my wife’s cousin, who was released in exchange for Mr Shalit, was among the leaders of the Oct 7 terrorist attacks, according to Israel’s report of his recent killing.Dim prospectsI have no official authorisation as a negotiator, but as far as I know I’m the only Israeli citizen who has contacts both with the leadership of Hamas and the leadership of Israel, so I have been in continual touch with both sides in hopes of advancing some long-term agreement. The release of those first two hostages is a positive development, but overall, prospects remain dim. Hamas continues to demand an end to “Israel’s aggression against Gaza”, and Israel says it has no intention of ending this war “until the job is done”. Mr Hamad has not backed down from Hamas’ brutal attacks.In my conversations with Hamas leaders, I have pushed them to release the women, children, elderly and sick as a humanitarian gesture. Hamas rejected the idea. I believe that Israel is open to accept a small deal in exchange for such a group, so I proposed to my Hamas contacts that they trade them for the 33 Palestinian women and 170 Palestinian minors currently in Israeli prisons, according to Addameer. Hamas rejected that, too. Right now, Hamas’ focus is achieving a comprehensive ceasefire.There are still official talks taking place. Qatar is speaking with Hamas and the United States is speaking with Qatar and Israel. This is too convoluted and complex. There need to be direct talks between Israel, Qatar and Hamas, and no one else. Not the US, and not Iran. The agreement of Hamas to release the two Americans was apparently negotiated by the Qataris and assisted by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The US still has a role to play. It should continue to pressure Qatar, which should give an ultimatum that if hostages are not released within, say, 24 hours, all of Hamas’ leaders will be expelled from Qatar, where many are based. I don’t believe that Qatar will agree to that – and certainly not without an Israeli ceasefire – but the American government and others have leverage over Qatar and it should be used.There is still a small chance and a limited window of opportunity before the ground assault begins to attain the release of some of the hostages through this kind of agreement. After the invasion begins, it will depend on Israeli special forces to try to save them.Some will again see their homes; others may not.At the other end of this war, I hope that the trauma and suffering we are all feeling on both sides of the conflict will spur us to figure out how to share this land that belongs to both Israelis and Palestinians. Maybe our collective suffering and pain can be channelled to focusing on how to live together rather than killing each other. That will be a long process and cannot include the leaders on both sides who have brought us to where we are.We need a new generation of leaders with new vision, new hopes, new dreams and the ability to lead. I hope that many of the hostages, together with their families, will soon be able to join the voices calling for change.

       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM - Israeli forces and Hamas militants appeared to be battling at close range in Gaza City as thousands of civilians fled south on Wednesday to avoid being trapped in the heart of the conflict.The Israeli military said its troops had advanced into the heart of Gaza City, Hamas’ main bastion and the biggest city in the seaside enclave, while the Islamist group said its fighters had inflicted heavy losses. Hamas’ armed wing on Wednesday released a video that appeared to show intense street battles alongside bombed out buildings in Gaza City.Israeli tanks have met heavy resistance from Hamas fighters using underground tunnels to stage ambushes, according to sources with Iran-backed Hamas and the separate Islamic Jihad militant group.Israel struck Gaza in response to a cross-border Hamas raid on southern Israel on Oct 7 in which gunmen killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Palestinian officials said 10,569 people have been killed as at Wednesday, 40 per cent of them children. Israel says 33 of its soldiers have been killed.One clip from the Hamas video released on Wednesday showed fighters running past piles of debris and stopping to fire shoulder-propelled missiles at Israeli tanks. Another showed them shooting rifles from perches behind buildings and dumpsters. Reuters was not able to authenticate the footage.Exiled Hamas commander Saleh al-Arouri told Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV that Israeli forces may gain control of some areas in Gaza.“But that will not stop the resistance’s fight against soldiers and tanks. The more (Israel) spreads and expands on the ground, the deeper its losses will become”, he said.Israel bombs tunnelsChief Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said on Wednesday that combat engineers were using explosive devices to destroy Hamas’ tunnel network that stretches for hundreds of kilometres beneath Gaza. The military said it had destroyed 130 tunnel shafts so far. Israel has blamed Hamas for civilian deaths in Gaza, saying it is using Gazans as human shields and hiding arms and operations centres in residential areas.As the war entered its second month, Israeli troops took foreign reporters to the edges of Gaza City on Wednesday. Journalists saw a devastated landscape where every building within sight was scarred by battle.Walls were blown away while bullet holes and shrapnel dotted the facades and palm trees were shredded and broken.Lieutenant Colonel Ido, deputy commander of the 401st Brigade, who did not give his last name, said that by the time soldiers reached these buildings, all the families had left.“So we know that everyone here is our enemy. We have not seen any civilians here. Only Hamas,” he said, standing in a badly damaged children’s bedroom that was painted pink.Soldiers on the press tour said that beneath the family apartment were two floors of workshops used to make weapons, including drones discovered in five wooden boxes. It was not possible to verify the claim.50,000 Palestinians head southSome 50,000 Palestinian civilians left the north on Wednesday, Rear-Adm Hagari said, during a four-hour window of opportunity announced by Israel. He said they left “because they understand that Hamas has lost control in the north”.Thousands still remain inside the encircled north, including at Gaza City’s main Al Shifa hospital, where Ms Um Haitham Hejela was sheltering with her young children in an improvised tent.“The situation is getting worse day after day,” she said. “There is no food, no water. When my son goes to pick up water, he queues for three or four hours in the line.”The Israeli military has repeatedly told residents to evacuate the north or risk being trapped in the violence. Huge numbers of displaced people from among Gaza’s 2.3 million population are already crammed into schools, hospitals and other sites in the south.But the central and southern parts of the small, besieged Palestinian enclave also came under fire again.Palestinian health officials said an air strike that hit houses in the Nusseirat refugee camp killed 18 people on Wednesday morning. In Khan Younis, six people, including a young girl, were killed in an air strike.“We were sitting in peace when all of a sudden an F16 air strike landed on a house and blew it up, the entire block, three houses next to each other,” said witness Mohammed Abu Daqa.“Civilians, all of them civilians. An old woman, an old man and there are others still missing under the rubble.”International alarm is mounting over the humanitarian toll of Israel’s onslaught. The level of death and suffering is “hard to fathom”, UN health agency spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said in Geneva.UN officials and G-7 world powers stepped up appeals for a humanitarian pause in the war to help alleviate the suffering of civilians in Gaza, where necessities including food, medicine and fuel are running out.Negotiations mediated by Qatar, where several Hamas political leaders are based, are trying to secure the release of 10 to 15 hostages in exchange for a one- to two-day humanitarian pause in Gaza, a source briefed on the talks said on Wednesday.Possible third strike on JabaliaAt least 19 people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house near a hospital in north Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp on Wednesday, the enclave’s Interior Ministry said.There was no immediate Israeli comment or details from the scene of the reported attack, which if confirmed would be the third on Gaza’s largest refugee camp in a week.The Palestinian authorities said at least 195 civilians were killed in those Israeli strikes, which flattened multi-storey dwellings. Israel said its air attacks on Jabalia last week killed two Hamas commanders and a number of militants while targeting operational tunnels dug beneath civilian districts. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The Hamas tunnel city beneath Gaza – a hidden front line for Israel',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM/LONDON - What lies in wait for Israeli ground troops in Gaza, security sources say, is a Hamas tunnel network hundreds of kilometres long and up to 80m deep, described by one freed hostage as “a spider’s web” and by one expert as the “Viet Cong times 10”.The Palestinian militant group has different kinds of tunnels running beneath the sandy 360 sq km coastal strip and its borders.These include attack, smuggling, storage and operational burrows, Western and Middle East sources familiar with the matter said.The United States believes Israel’s special forces will face an unprecedented challenge having to battle Hamas militants while trying to avoid killing hostages held below ground, a US official said.US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin noted that Iraq’s nine-month-long battle to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State might prove to have been easier than what awaits the Israelis – likely to be “a lot of IEDs (improvised explosive devices), a lot of booby traps, and just a really grinding activity”.Israel has invested heavily in\\xa0tunnel detection – including a sensor-equipped underground barrier it called an “iron wall”.But Hamas is still thought to have working tunnels to the outside world.After the last round of hostilities in 2021, Hamas’s leader in Gaza Yahya Al-Sinwar said: “They started saying they destroyed 100km of Hamas tunnels. I am telling you, the tunnels we have in the Gaza Strip exceed 500km. Even if their narrative is true, they only destroyed 20 per cent of the tunnels.”Hostage witnessThere has been no corroboration of the comment by Mr Sinwar, who is thought to be hiding underground ahead of an expected Israeli ground offensive.But the estimate of hundreds of kilometres is widely accepted by security analysts, even though the blockaded coastal strip is only 40km long.With Israel in full control of Gaza’s air and sea access and 59km of its 72km land borders – with Egypt controlling 13km to the south – tunnels provide one of the few ways for Hamas to bring in weapons, equipment and people.While it and other Palestinian groups are secretive about their networks, recently released Israeli hostage, 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz, said: “It looked like a spider’s web, many, many tunnels,” adding: “We walked kilometres under the ground.”Hamas believes that with Israel’s overwhelming aerial and armoured military superiority, tunnels are a way to cut some of those advantages by forcing Israel’s soldiers to move underground in cramped spaces the Hamas fighters know well.An Israeli military spokesperson said on Thursday: “I won’t elaborate on the number of kilometres of tunnels but it is a high number, built under schools and residential areas.”Urging the United Nations Security Council to intervene, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called for an immediate cessation of “aggression” on Gaza, and asked for moves towards “a political solution instead of military and security solutions”.Underground city Israeli security sources say Israel’s heavy aerial bombardments have caused little damage to the tunnel infrastructure, with Hamas naval commandos able to launch a seaborne attack targeting coastal communities near Gaza this week.“Although we have been attacking massively for days and days, the (Hamas) leadership is pretty much intact, as is the ability to command and control, the ability even to try and launch counter-attacks,” said Mr Amir Avivi, a former brigadier general whose senior positions in the Israeli military included deputy commander of the Gaza division, tasked with tackling tunnels.“There is a whole city all over Gaza underneath with depths of 40m to 50m. There are bunkers and headquarters and storage, and of course they are connected to more than a thousand rocket launching positions.”Other sources estimated depths of up to 80m.One Western security source said: “They run for miles. They are made of concrete, and very well made. Think of the Viet Cong times 10. They have had years and lots of money with which to work with.”Another security source from one of Israel’s neighbouring countries said Hamas’s tunnels from Egypt remain active.“The supply chain is still intact these days. The network involved in facilitating coordination (includes) some Egyptian military officers. It is unclear if there is knowledge of this by the Egyptian army,” he said.A small number of narrower deep smuggling tunnels were still operating until recently between Egypt and Gaza, according to two security sources and a trader in the Egyptian city of El Arish, but operations had slowed to a near halt since the Israel-Hamas war started. Egyptian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday\\xa0Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said, while inspecting military units in Suez, that the army’s role was to secure Egyptian borders. \\xa0Long gameHamas was created in Gaza in 1987 and is thought to have begun digging tunnels in the mid-1990s, when Israel granted Mr Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organisation some degree of self-rule in Gaza.The tunnel network is a key reason why Hamas is stronger in Gaza than in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Israel’s settlements, military bases and monitoring devices make it harder to get anything in from Jordan.Tunnelling became easier in 2005 when Israel pulled its soldiers and settlers out of Gaza, and when Hamas won power in a 2006 election.Shortly afterwards, Hamas’s military wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and killed two others after burrowing 600m to raid the Kerem Shalom base on the Gaza border.A year later, Hamas launched a military strike against Mr Arafat’s forces in Gaza using tunnel-mounted attacks.Although the military tunnels remained off-limits to outside eyes, during that era Gaza smugglers would show off their scarcely concealed commercial tunnels under the Rafah border.These were around 1m wide and used winch motors to haul goods along the sandy tunnel floors in hollowed-out petrol barrels.One Rafah tunnel operator, Mr Abu Qusay, said a 800m tunnel took three to six months to dig and could yield profits of up to US$100,000 (S$137,100) a day. The most profitable item was bullets, bought for US$1 each in Egypt and fetched more than US$6 in Gaza. Kalashnikov rifles, he said, cost US$800 in Egypt and sold for twice that.In 2007, the military wing is thought to have brought its commander Mohammed Deif into Gaza through a tunnel from Egypt. Deif was the mastermind behind Hamas’s Oct 7 attack into Israel, which killed 1,400 people.Tunnel huntingProfessor Joel Roskin, a geomorphologist and geologist with Israel’s Bar-Ilan University, said it was difficult to map the tunnel network accurately from the surface or space.He added that highly classified information was essential for 3D mapping and imagery visualisation.Among the elite units tasked with going underground is Yahalom, specialist commandos from Israel’s Combat Engineering Corps known as “weasels” who specialise in finding, clearing and destroying the tunnels.Earlier this week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Yahalom fighters, telling them: “I rely on you, the people of Israel rely on you.”Israeli sources said what awaits them is formidable, and they faced an enemy that has regrouped and learned from previous Israeli operations in 2014 and 2021.“There are going to be a lot of booby traps. They have thermobaric weapons that they didn’t have in 2021, which are more lethal. And I believe they acquired a lot of anti-tank weapon systems that are going to try to hit our APCs (armoured personnel carriers), tanks,” said Mr Amnon Sofrin, a former brigadier general and former commander of the Combat Intelligence Corps.Mr Sofrin, who was also previously head of the intelligence directorate with Israel’s Mossad spy agency, said Hamas would also be trying to kidnap soldiers.Professor Daphne Richemond-Barak at Israel’s Reichman University and author of the book Underground Warfare said the conflicts in Syria and Iraq had changed the situation.“What the IDF (Israeli military) is likely to face inside the tunnels is also all of the experience and all of the knowledge that has been gained by groups like ISIS (Islamic State) and has been... passed on to Hamas.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'KIBBUTZ MISHMAR HA’EMEK, Israel – The 10 gunmen from Gaza knew exactly how to find the Israeli intelligence hub – and how to get inside.After crossing into Israel, they headed east on five motorcycles, two gunmen on each vehicle, shooting at passing civilian cars as they pressed forward.Over 15km later, they veered off the road into a stretch of woodland, dismounting outside an unmanned gate to a military base. They blew open the barrier with a small explosive charge, entered the base and paused to take a group selfie. Then they shot dead an unarmed Israeli soldier dressed in a T-shirt.For a moment, the attackers appeared uncertain about where to go next. Then one of them pulled something from his pocket: a colour-coded map of the complex.Reoriented, they found an unlocked door to a fortified building. Once inside, they entered a room filled with computers – the military intelligence hub. Under a bed in the room, they found two soldiers taking shelter.The gunmen shot both dead.This sequence was captured on a camera mounted on the head of a gunman who was later killed. The New York Times reviewed the footage, then verified the events by interviewing Israeli officials and checking Israeli military video of the attack.They provide chilling details of how Hamas, the militia that controls the Gaza Strip, managed to surprise and outmanoeuvre the most powerful military in the Middle East last Saturday – storming across the border, overrunning more than 70 sq km, taking more than 150 hostages and killing more than 1,300 people in the deadliest day for Israel in its 75-year history.With meticulous planning and extraordinary awareness of Israel’s secrets and weaknesses, Hamas and its allies overwhelmed the length of Israel’s front with Gaza shortly after dawn, shocking a nation that has long taken the superiority of its military as an article of faith.Using drones, Hamas destroyed key surveillance and communications towers along the border with Gaza, imposing vast blind spots on the Israeli military. With explosives and tractors, Hamas blew open gaps in the border barricades, allowing 200 attackers to pour through in the first wave and another 1,800 later that day, officials say. On motorcycles and in pickup trucks, the assailants surged into Israel, overwhelming at least eight military bases and waging terrorist attacks against civilians in more than 15 villages and cities.Hamas planning documents, videos of the assault and interviews with security officials show that the group had a surprisingly sophisticated understanding of how the Israeli military operated, where it stationed specific units, and even the time it would take for reinforcements to arrive.The Israeli military says that, once the war is over, it will investigate how Hamas managed to breach its defences so easily.But whether the armed forces were careless with their secrets or infiltrated by spies, the revelations have already unnerved officials and analysts who have questioned how the Israeli military – renowned for its intelligence gathering – could have inadvertently revealed so much information about its own operations.The outcome was a staggering series of atrocities and massacres, in what Israeli President Isaac Herzog has described as the worst mass killing of Jews in a single day since the Holocaust.It shattered Israel’s aura of invincibility and provoked an Israeli counter-attack on Gaza that has killed more than 1,900 Palestinians in a week, the ferocity of which has never been seen in Gaza.It also upended assumptions that Hamas, long designated a terrorist group by Israel and many Western nations, had gradually become more interested in running Gaza than in using it to launch major assaults on Israel.Hamas made Israelis think it was “busy with governing Gaza”, Mr Ali Barakeh, a Hamas leader, said in a television interview on Monday. “All the while, under the table, Hamas was preparing for this big attack.”‘Hamas in the kibbutz!’The terrorists were inside Mrs Addi Cherry’s home, on the other side of an unlocked door.Mrs Cherry, her husband and their three children were hiding inside their eldest son’s bedroom, listening to the gunmen wander around their living room.“Please help us,” Mrs Cherry texted a friend as one of the assailants walked closer and closer to the bedroom door.Then he gripped the door handle.The Cherry family’s day had begun with a burst of rockets from Gaza, not long after 6am.Mrs Cherry, an economist, and her husband Oren, an engineer, rushed with their children into their eldest son’s bedroom, which doubled as a bomb shelter.Initially, the events of the morning felt distressingly familiar. The Cherry family lives in kibbutz Nahal Oz, a rural village of some 500 residents in Israel, a few hundred yards east of the border with Gaza. Early morning rocket fire – and the ensuing rush to the safe room – is a frequent feature of life in the region.“Like always,” Mrs Cherry remembered thinking.But this morning soon felt different. The rockets kept coming, many of them headed deep into Israeli territory.Then, from the fields around the village, came the sound of gunshots.Mr Cherry left the bedroom and peeked through the shutters on their living room windows.“‘Oh, God’,” Mrs Cherry remembered her husband shouting. “‘Hamas in the kibbutz! Hamas in the kibbutz!’”It was 7.20am.Hundreds of Hamas invaders, carrying guns and shoulder-borne rocket launchers and wearing the group’s green headband, were streaming through the village fields.It was part of a coordinated assault that, documents and video show, assigned squads of assailants to precise targets. As some swept through military bases, others charged into residential areas, ruthlessly kidnapping and killing civilians.They would reach the Cherrys’ street within minutes.The family had to act quickly. Their bomb shelter – a teenager’s bedroom – had no lock.The parents grabbed a chair and wedged it under the door handle – making it harder to open.They dragged a small cabinet across the floor and pressed it against the chair.Then they waited. There was an army base next to the village. Its troops would be here within minutes, Mrs Cherry remembered thinking.What she did not know was that many of them were already dead.‘Take soldiers and civilians’All along the border, the Hamas gunmen had already overrun most, if not all, of the Israeli border bases.Footage from the attackers’ head-mounted cameras, including the video of the raid on the intelligence hub, showed Hamas gunmen – from its highly trained Nukhba brigade – smashing through the barricades of several bases in the first light of the morning.After breaching, they were merciless, gunning down some soldiers in their beds and underwear. In several bases, they knew exactly where the communications servers were and destroyed them, according to a senior Israeli army officer.With much of their communications and surveillance systems down, the Israelis often could not see the commandos coming. They found it harder to call for help and mount a response. In many cases, they were unable to protect themselves, let alone the surrounding civilian villages.A Hamas planning document – found by Israeli emergency responders in one village – showed that the attackers were organised into well-defined units with clear goals and battle plans.One platoon had designated navigators, saboteurs and drivers – and mortar units in the rear to provide cover for the attackers, the document shows.The group had a specific target – a kibbutz – and the attackers were tasked with storming the village from specific angles. They had estimates for how many Israeli troops were stationed in nearby posts, how many vehicles they had at their disposal and how long it would take those Israeli relief forces to reach them.The document is dated October 2022, suggesting that the attack had been planned for at least a year.Elsewhere, other assailants were posted to key road junctions to ambush Israeli reinforcements, according to four senior officers and officials.Some units had specific instructions to capture Israelis for use as bargaining chips in future prisoner exchanges with Israel.“Take soldiers and civilians as prisoners and hostages to negotiate with,” the document said.‘We are going to die’The terrorists smashed their way into the Cherrys’ house shortly before 10am, according to texts that Mrs Cherry sent to friends at the time.They had already killed the kibbutz guards and a civilian security volunteer who had rushed to confront them in the opening moments of the assault, according to the village leadership.Now the terrorists were going house by house, trying to find people to kill and kidnap.“Please send help,” Mrs Cherry typed into her phone.At the Cherrys’ house, they forced their way in through the door. They charged in, shouting and ransacking the house, Mrs Cherry said.“We are going to die,” she remembered thinking.The family waited in terrified silence, hoping the intruders would ignore the door to the bedroom and assume everyone was away.Mrs Cherry and her husband put all their weight against the cabinet, to brace the chair underneath the door handle.Guy, 15, their eldest son, stood next to the door, holding an 18-pound dumbbell. If someone did break in, the plan was to drop it on the assailant’s head.Then the handle twitched.The parents began to push the cabinet.The handle continued to rattle.Then it stopped. The assailant walked away.A few streets away, the family of Mr Miki Levi, who oversees the kibbutz gardens, had an even closer call.After a terrorist squad chased Mr Levi, 47, inside his safe room, the attackers sprayed bullets at the reinforced door, Mr Levi said in an interview.Some of the bullets pierced the door, creating large openings, and Mr Levi said he also fired back with his pistol, shredding it further. His wife and two young daughters sheltered to the side.Changing tactics, the terrorists later brought two of his neighbours – a mother and her 12-year-old daughter, Mr Levi said.At gunpoint, the mother and child were told to persuade him to open up, Mr Levi said.“‘Come out and stop shooting’,” Mr Levi recounted one of them saying. “‘The terrorists won’t do anything to you’.”Eventually, the terrorists gave up that approach and returned with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, Mr Levi said.It was only when Mr Levi shot one attacker in the thigh that they finally left, he added.The mother and child, Mr Levi suspects, are now captives in Gaza.‘Bodies were burning’Brigadier-General Dan Goldfus said he drove south without knowing where exactly he should go.The 46-year-old paratrooper commander had been on leave at home, jogging in his neighbourhood north of Tel Aviv, Israel. Then he saw a video from the south, showing terrorists cruising through a city, entirely unimpeded.Without waiting for orders, the general said he ran home, changed into his uniform and headed south.He picked up guns and two soldiers from his base in central Israel and called friends and colleagues to find out what was happening.Only a few picked up. Of the rest, “there was nobody really understanding the full picture”, Brig-Gen Goldfus said in an interview.The speed, precision and scale of Hamas’ attack had thrown the Israeli military into disarray, and for many hours afterwards, civilians were left to fend for themselves.Using the few scraps of information he could glean, Brig-Gen Goldfus said he and the soldiers headed to a village north of Nahal Oz, then gradually worked their way south.It was around 10am. All around him was carnage and atrocity.Dead Israelis lined the roads, alongside the husks of burnt-out, overturned cars.At the site of an all-night outdoor rave, gunmen had killed an estimated 260 partygoers.“Bodies were burning,” Brig-Gen Goldfus remembered seeing at the site.The attack by Hamas had unleashed a violent free-for-all. Some residents of Gaza had poured over the undefended border after it was breached, at times streaming what they were doing on their phones. Gazans were looting and ransacking homes, taking computers, clothes, crockery, televisions and phones, survivors said.In some Israeli villages, residents had been burned alive in their homes while terrorists stalked civilians at every turn, looking for people to capture and kill. Grandparents, toddlers and a nine-month-old baby were seized and taken back to Gaza, some of them squeezed between their kidnappers on motorcycles.During much of the mayhem, the Israeli army was almost nowhere to be seen.Near the kibbutz of Reim, Brig-Gen Goldfus said he ran into another senior commander by chance. Like him, the officer had rushed to the scene on instinct, without any instructions, and had assembled a small group of soldiers.There and then, the two men came up with their own ad hoc strategy.“There’s no orders here,” Brig-Gen Goldfus said. “I said, ‘You take from this place and further south – and I’ll take from this place and further north’.”That was how some of the Israeli counter-attack took place: soldiers or civilian volunteers – including retired generals in their 60s – rushing to the region and doing what they could.Mr Israel Ziv, a former general, reached a nearby battle in his Audi.Mr Yair Golan, a retired deputy chief of staff and former leftist lawmaker, said he took a gun and began rescuing survivors of a massacre at a rave who were hiding in nearby bushes.“We are brought up to run as fast as possible towards the fire,” said Brig-Gen Goldfus. “So that we can be the first one there.”‘It’s OK. We’re Jewish.’The intelligence hub near Gaza was one of the first places to be recaptured by Israel.In the late morning, soldiers and reservists from different units reached the base from separate directions, overpowering the 10 Gazan gunmen who had filmed their deadly assault on video.The camera mounted on the Hamas commander’s head captured the moment he was shot and killed. The camera falls off, bouncing along the ground. By the time the video stops, the commander can be seen slumped on the ground, revealing his long beard and thinning hairline.In other parts of southern Israel, the first formal reinforcements came from an Israeli commando unit that arrived in helicopters, according to a senior Israeli officer.They were followed by other special operations units, including Israeli navy seals and a reconnaissance unit trained to operate deep inside enemy lines rather than on Israeli soil.Sometimes, the commandos joined forces with volunteers without body armour who had rushed into the fray to rescue family members.Mr Noam Tibon, a former general, drove south with his pistol to try to retake Nahal Oz, where his son Amir, a journalist, was trapped.In the early afternoon, the elder Mr Tibon joined a squad that was making its way through the kibbutz, house by house.By Sunday afternoon, several villages and bases still had some kind of Hamas presence. The whole area would not be fully secured for days.Mrs Cherry emerged at around 5pm on Saturday in Nahal Oz to find her home turned upside down, the microwave torn from the wall, drawers ripped from their cabinets and a pool of drying blood on the floor.She had heard a gun battle in and around her home earlier in the day. She believed a terrorist had died in the house – and that his bloodied corpse had been carried off by fellow fighters.Some survivors refused to open up, even after the army arrived.When soldiers reached the home of Ms Oshrit Sabag, another resident of Nahal Oz, she feared they were terrorists in disguise.Even after the soldiers began chatting to one another in Hebrew to prove who they were, Ms Sabag, 48, was unconvinced.It was only their Jewish prayers that made her relax.“‘It’s OK, it’s OK,’” Ms Sabag remembered them saying. “‘We’re Jewish.’” NYTIMES',\n",

       "  'Text': 'DUBAI – The heads of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Israel’s Mossad met Qatar’s prime minister in Doha on Nov 28 to build on the two-day extension of a truce between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, a source briefed on the visit said. The meeting was “to build on the progress of the extended humanitarian pause agreement and to initiate further discussions about the next phase of a potential deal”, the source told Reuters.The outcome of the talks, which were also attended by Egyptian officials, was unclear, the source added.Mr David Barnea, the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service, CIA director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani met one day after Qatar announced the two-day extension of an original four-day truce deal in Gaza that had been due to expire overnight.Qatar, where several political leaders of Hamas are based, has been leading negotiations between the Palestinian militant group and Israel.The truce has brought the first respite to the Gaza Strip in seven weeks, during which Israel bombed the territory heavily in response to a violent rampage on Oct 7 by Hamas gunmen who killed around 1,200 people and took 240 captives.Israel has sworn to annihilate Hamas, which rules Gaza. The health authorities in Gaza say Israel’s bombardment of the tiny, densely populated territory has so far killed more than 15,000 people, around 40 per cent of them children.Mr Barnea and Mr Burns were previously in Qatar to meet Sheikh Mohammed on Nov 9.During the first four days of the truce, Hamas fighters released 50 Israeli women and children who had been taken hostage. In return, Israel released 150 security detainees from its jails, all women and teenagers.As part of the two-day truce extension Hamas has agreed to release an additional 10 Israeli women and children each day.So far, there is no indication that Hamas is willing to release any Israeli men or military personnel among those taken captive.

       "  'Text': 'GAZA  -     As an unrelenting Israeli bombardment intensified on Saturday, bakeries in Gaza were running out of bread, drinking water was in short supply and power outages left families without charged phones to find out if fleeing relatives were safe.\"There is an electricity crisis, food crisis, water crisis, a crisis of everything,\" Eyad Abu Mutlaq, 45, said in Khan Younis in south Gaza, a region filling up with thousands of people fleeing the north for fear of an Israeli invasion.\"It is only God who can resolve it,\" he said after touring four bakeries to find long queues or no supplies.The flood of people arriving in south Gaza after Israel told them on Friday to leave an area in the north has stretched resources that were already strained to breaking point.The United Nations has urged Israel to \"avert a humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza, a slither of land with 2.3 million people wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.In its response to the devastating Oct. 7 assault from Gaza by Palestinian militant group Hamas, Israel has imposed a \"total blockade\" halting food supplies and cutting electricity to Gaza. A week after that began, shops are running out of many items.\"I was looking for basic food, eggs, rice, canned food, even milk for the children and I couldn’t find them,\" said Khan Younis resident, giving only her nickname of Um Salem. \"This is how Israel is fighting us, through starvation of our children. They either kill children by bombs or soon by starvation.\"Israel said it had told people to leave the north for their safety and to ensure they were not caught up in the conflict. It said it would guarantee the safety of Palestinians fleeing the area on two main roads until 4 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Friday.Those who have fled say many roads and streets are often difficult to use, and some impassable, because of damage.APPEAL TO END THE \\'SIEGE\\'Gaza authorities said 70 people were killed and 200 were wounded when Israel struck cars and trucks carrying people fleeing the north. Reuters could not independently verify this.The Hamas assault last week killed more than 1,300 Israelis. The fighters also took scores of hostages in the worst breach of Israel\\'s defences since its creation in 1948.The death toll from Israel\\'s response was more than 2,200 people by Saturday.Without the option of crossing the border into Egypt, more of Gaza\\'s population has been cramming into the south seeking shelter, as Israel builds up troops and tanks on border. Israel has already launched raids.\"We need to truck fuel into Gaza now. Fuel is the only way for people to have safe drinking water. If not, people will start dying of severe dehydration, among them young children, the elderly and women,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the U.N. refugee agency UNRWA,.\"Water is now the last remaining lifeline. I appeal for the siege on humanitarian assistance to be lifted now,\" he said.U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday he was making it a priority to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, working with Israel, Egypt, Jordan, other Arab states and the U.N. He said he was also ensuring Israel had what it needed to respond to the Oct. 7 attack, including bringing any U.S. hostages home.The Gaza authorities have reported 10,000 people injured so far in the bombardment. Hospitals are struggling to cope. Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra said hospitals were running low of medical supplies and fuel to keep going.More than 1,695 buildings and high-rise towers have been destroyed in the Israeli airstrikes, in addition to 7,000 housing units, the Hamas government media office said.With power cuts and no fuel to operate generators, Adel Shaheen has been charging people\\'s phones with his solar panels during daylight hours.\"We don\\'t see the electricity anymore and if we want to charge a mobile we have to wait for the sun, otherwise we have no electricity at all,” he said. \"People want to charge (mobile phones) so they can make calls to check on their families.\"But he said most Gazans were now \"cut off from the world\".

       "  'Title': 'Israel makes first raids into Gaza; Netanyahu says it is ‘only the beginning’',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM – Israeli infantry made their first raids into the Gaza Strip on Friday since Hamas fighters rampaged through southern Israel, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a campaign of retaliation had only just begun. Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas after its fighters burst out of Gaza a week ago and stormed through towns and villages, killing 1,300 Israelis, mainly civilians, and making off with scores of hostages.Since then, Israel has placed the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, under a total siege and bombarded it with unprecedented air strikes. The Gaza authorities say 1,900 people have died.On Friday, Israel gave more than a million residents of the northern half of Gaza 24 hours to flee to the south to avoid an onslaught. Hamas vowed to fight to the last drop of blood and told residents not to go.Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said troops backed by tanks had mounted raids to attack Palestinian rocket crews and seek information on the location of hostages, the first official account of ground troops in Gaza since the crisis began.“We are striking our enemies with unprecedented might,” Mr Netanyahu said, in a brief statement which, unusually, was televised after the Jewish Sabbath had begun.“I emphasise that this is only the beginning.”Several thousand Gaza residents took to roads heading out of the northern part of the Gaza Strip, but it was impossible to assess their numbers. Many others said they would not leave.“Death is better than leaving,” said Mohammad, 20, standing in the street outside a building reduced to rubble in an earlier Israeli air strike near the centre of Gaza.Mosques broadcast the message: “Hold on to your homes. Hold on to your land.”“We tell the people of northern Gaza and from Gaza City, stay put in your homes, and your places,” Mr Eyad Al-Bozom, spokesman for the Hamas Interior Ministry, told a news conference.The Gaza authorities said 70 people were killed and 200 were wounded when Israel struck cars and lorries carrying people fleeing the north of the strip for the south. Reuters could not independently verify the reported incident.The United Nations and other organisations warned of a disaster if so many people were forced to flee, and said the siege of the enclave should be lifted to let in aid.The situation in Gaza has reached a “a dangerous new low”, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday.“We need immediate humanitarian access throughout Gaza, so that we can get fuel, food and water to everyone in need. Even wars have rules.”Earlier, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said it would be impossible for Gazans to obey Israel’s order to leave the north without “devastating humanitarian consequences”, prompting a rebuke from Israel that the UN should condemn Hamas and support Israel’s right to self-defence.“The noose around the civilian population in Gaza is tightening. How are 1.1 million people supposed to move across a densely populated war zone in less than 24 hours?“ UN aid chief Martin Griffiths wrote on social media.‘Distance yourselves from Hamas’White House national security spokesman John Kirby said such a huge evacuation was a “tall order”, but that Washington would not second guess Israel’s decision to tell civilians to get out.“We understand what they’re trying to do and why they’re trying to do this – to try to isolate the civilian population from Hamas, which is their real target,” he said on MSNBC.Mr Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority that is a rival of Hamas, told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Jordan that the forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza would constitute a repeat of 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from what is now Israel. Most Gazans are the descendants of such refugees.Gaza is already one of the most crowded places on earth, and for now there is no way out. Israel has imposed a total blockade, and Egypt, which also has a border with the enclave, has so far resisted calls to open it to fleeing residents.‘I promise you, we will win’Hamas issued a video on Friday purporting to show its fighters cuddling a baby and a toddler in one of the villages it ransacked. Israel has said entire families were slaughtered.“We are fighting for our home. We are fighting for our future,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said, meeting US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who came to Israel a day after a visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. “The path will be long, but ultimately I promise you, we will win.”Mr Austin said military aid was flowing into Israel but that this was the time for resolve and not revenge.On Friday, Mr Blinken travelled to Jordan where he met King Abdullah as well as Mr Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank but lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007. Mr Blinken later travelled to Qatar, a United States ally with influence among Islamist groups.In the West Bank, demonstrators supporting Gaza fought gun battles with Israeli security forces. Palestinian officials said 11 people were shot dead.There have also been fears of hostilities spreading to new fronts, including Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, where clashes this week have already been the deadliest since 2006.Reuters news videographer Issam Abdallah was killed on Friday while working in southern Lebanon. Reuters said it was seeking more information and working with the authorities in the region.Earlier, Reuters reported that Israeli shelling had struck a Lebanese army observation post at the border. The Israeli military said it fired in response to a suspected armed infiltration, which it later said had been a false alarm. Lebanese state media reported that shells struck near Alma Al-Shaab and Dhayra, sites of repeated clashes in the past week.Israel’s UN envoy said it would investigate what had happened in the area following the journalist’s death.“We always try to mitigate and avoid civilian casualties. Obviously, we would never want to hit or kill or shoot any journalist that is doing its job,” Mr Gilad Erdan said. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Why Hezbollah is a wild card as Israel takes aim at Hamas',\n",
       "  'Text': 'BEIRUT – The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah last fought a war with Israel in 2006. Since 2013, when it turned its attention to helping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad prevail against rebels, Israeli officials have warned that a day would come when Hezbollah’s fighters would again turn their focus to Israel – this time having gained significant combat experience and better weaponry. As Israel’s military faces off against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, following their bloody invasion of southern Israel on Saturday, Israeli leadership has a wary eye on the threat posed by Hezbollah to the north. 1. What is Hezbollah?Shiite Muslims in Lebanon formed what would become Hezbollah – “party of God” – in 1982, in reaction to Israel’s occupation of the country’s south. The movement was inspired by the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Shiite-majority Iran, and Hezbollah to some extent became a proxy force for Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards. Shiite Muslims and Sunni Muslims each comprise about 30 per cent of Lebanon’s population. Iran provides Hezbollah with “most of its funding, training, weapons and explosives, as well as political, diplomatic, monetary, and organisational aid”, according to the US State Department, which says the group also gets funding from legal and illegal sources, including “smuggling contraband goods, passport falsification, narcotics trafficking, money laundering and credit card, immigration and bank fraud”. Because it is separate from Lebanon’s military, Hezbollah can attack Israeli and US targets without provoking the reaction such a move by a state would precipitate.\\xa02. What US targets has Hezbollah attacked?The group is thought to have been behind the 1983 suicide truck bombings of the US Embassy and US Marine barracks in Beirut, the 1984 attack on the US Embassy annex in Beirut and the 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847.3. What is Hezbollah’s role inside Lebanon?Hezbollah remains a powerful force in Lebanon. It operates a large network of social services for its followers and is politically active, losing a majority in the country’s Parliament just last year. Hezbollah’s alliance with the Shiite Amal movement, headed by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, ensures that together they represent most of the country’s Shiite community. Hezbollah also has close ties with the Christian party founded by former president Michel Aoun. Before Syria’s civil war began in 2011, Hezbollah had promoted itself as a force dedicated to fighting Israel and defending the oppressed, regardless of their background. But since becoming enmeshed in Syria’s war, it has been viewed by many Sunni Muslims as a Shiite group doing Iran’s bidding in the region.4. Why did Hezbollah get involved in Syria?Since Lebanon is not connected to Iran, Syria has served as a way for Hezbollah to receive military material from its patron. So it was important for Hezbollah to help President Assad, an ally, maintain his hold on power.5. Will Hezbollah join Hamas in fighting Israel?Hezbollah has expressed solidarity with Hamas and has exchanged fire with Israel since the Saturday Hamas attack. Analysts say it may opt to attack Israel more forcefully, especially if Israeli troops move into Gaza. It is thought to have tens of thousands of missiles. Israeli officials have warned that their country’s military would target all of Lebanon if Hezbollah were to enter the war. BLOOMBERG',\n",

       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM - Israel\\'s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday to \"demolish Hamas\" as his troops prepared to move into the Gaza Strip in pursuit of Hamas militants whose deadly rampage through Israeli border towns shocked the world.Israel has urged exhausted Gazans to evacuate the south, which hundreds of thousands have already done in the besieged enclave that is home to more than 2 million people. Hamas, which runs Gaza, has told people to ignore Israel\\'s message. Inside Gaza\\'s narrow and crowded streets, conditions were deteriorating as deaths from Israeli air strikes rose. Bodies were stored in ice cream freezer trucks because moving them to hospitals was too risky and cemeteries were full.With fears of the conflict spilling further, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken continued his tour of Middle East states, seeking to prevent escalation and secure the release of 155 hostages Israel says were taken by Hamas back into Gaza.Arab leaders stressed the need to protect Gaza civilians.\"The reaction went beyond the right to self-defence, turning into collective punishment,\" said Egypt\\'s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Israel\\'s retaliatory strikes.Clashes on Israel\\'s border with Lebanon, the deadliest since 2006, have underscored the dangers of regional spillover. On Sunday, Hamas\\' armed wing Al Qassam Brigades said it fired 20 rockets from Lebanon at two Israeli settlements while Lebanon\\'s Hezbollah militia said it fired missiles at Israeli barracks in Hanita and had inflicted casualties.Israel said it was striking Lebanon in retaliation, and the UN peacekeeping force said its headquarters in south Lebanon had been hit by a rocket.Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, warned Israel of escalation if it kept attacking Palestinians. \"If the Zionist aggressions do not stop, the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger,\" said Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, adding that Teheran could not simply stay an observer.Mr Blinken met Saudi Arabia\\'s Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh then Sisi in Cairo. Amid international efforts to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Mr Blinken said the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt would reopen. \"There\\'s a determination in every country I went to, to make sure that this conflict doesn\\'t spread,\" said Mr Blinken, who was due back in Israel on Monday.\"They are using their own influence, their own relationships, to try to make sure that this doesn\\'t happen.\" ISRAELI RESOLVEMr Netanyahu convened Israel\\'s expanded emergency Cabinet, including former opposition lawmakers, in a show of unity. \"Hamas thought we would be demolished. It is we who will demolish Hamas,\" he said.Israel is carrying out the most intense bombardment Gaza has ever seen in response to the killing of 1,300 people when Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct 7. They shot men, women, children and soldiers and seized hostages in the worst attack on civilians in Israel\\'s history.Graphic video of the attacks, and reports from medical and emergency services in the overrun towns and kibbutzes, deepened Israelis\\' sense of shock. France said 19 of its citizens had died in the Hamas attacks, with 13 others still unaccounted for and possibly taken hostage. Canada raised its fatality toll to five.Authorities in Gaza said at least 2,670 people had so far been killed by Israel\\'s retaliatory strikes, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded. Another 1,000 people were missing and believed to be under rubble.Gaza hospitals are running short of supplies and struggling to cope with the numbers of wounded.Among them was four-year-old Fulla Al-Laham, 14 members of whose family, including her parents and siblings, died in an Israeli air strike. \"May God keep me alive to take care of her,\" said her grandmother Um Muhammed Al-Laham, who held the girl\\'s hand as she lay in a hospital on a drip with a bandaged arm.ON THE MOVEIsrael\\'s military, which has massed tanks on Gaza\\'s border in preparation for a ground offensive, says it is targeting Hamas and its infrastructure. Israeli aircraft on Sunday struck about 250 military targets, killing the Hamas southern district commander, the military said.Israeli military chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi told soldiers near the Gaza border they would be entering Gaza to root out Hamas, targeting \"every place, every commander, every operator.\"\"You are about to do something big and important, that needs to change the situation for a long time in a clear way,\" Mr Halevi said.An Israeli blockade has prevented fuel, food and water from entering Gaza, although Netanyahu had agreed with US President Joe Biden to resume the water supply to parts of southern Gaza, a minister said on Sunday. The Israeli military said some 600,000 Gazans had left the northern half of the territory, which includes Gaza City\\'s more than 1 million residents.Some Palestinians who went south said they were heading back north because they were attacked wherever they went.Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, an intensive care doctor on a children\\'s ward at the Kamal Edwan hospital in northern Gaza, said the order to evacuate was impossible.\"In this ward as you can see, there are children who are attached to ventilators, and now we have been asked to evacuate the hospital, where should we evacuate these children?\"The World Health Organization said Israel\\'s orders to evacuate 22 Gaza hospitals were a \"death sentence for the sick and injured\". UN relief operations in Gaza \"are on the verge of collapse,\" said Mr Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the UN agency for the Palestinians, UNRWA.\"The number of people seeking shelter in our schools and other UNRWA facilities in the south is absolutely overwhelming, and we do not have any more the capacity to deal with them,\" he said.

       "  'Title': 'What war crimes laws apply to the Israel-Palestinian conflict?',\n",
       "  'Text': 'THE HAGUE - Conflict between Israel and Palestinian forces since militant group Hamas\\' weekend assault have created a huge and rising death toll on both sides.The war falls under a complex international system of justice that has emerged since World War Two.What laws govern the conflict?Internationally accepted rules of armed conflict emerged out of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which have been ratified by all UN member states and supplemented by rulings at international war crimes tribunals.A series of treaties governs the treatment of civilians, soldiers and prisoners of war in a system collectively known as the \"Law of Armed Conflict\" or \"International Humanitarian Law\". It applies to government forces and organised armed groups, including Hamas militants.If alleged Palestinian perpetrators of atrocities in Israel and all alleged perpetrators of crimes on the occupied Palestinian territories are not brought to justice at home, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is the only international legal organ able to bring charges. Domestic courts can apply so-called universal jurisdiction in war crimes cases, but that would be limited in scope.The ICC\\'s founding Rome Statute gives it legal authority to investigate alleged crimes on the territory of its members or by their nationals, when domestic authorities are \"unwilling or unable\" to do so.On Tuesday, the office of the prosecutor of the ICC confirmed that its mandate applies to potential crimes committed in the current conflict and said it continues to gather information.What is the role of the ICC?The International Criminal Court (ICC), the world\\'s permanent war crimes tribunals, opened in The Hague in 2002. It has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in its 123 member states or committed by its nationals.Many of the world\\'s major powers are not members, including China, the United States, Russia, India and Egypt. The ICC recognises Palestine as a member state, while Israel rejects the court\\'s jurisdiction and does not formally engage with it. With a limited budget and staff, ICC prosecutors are already investigating 17 cases ranging from Ukraine and Afghanistan to Sudan and Myanmar. The ICC budget has allocated less than 100,000 euros ($106,000) for investigations in the Palestinian territories for 2023 and is seeking additional resources.The ICC has had an ongoing investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the occupied Palestinian territories since 2021. It has not issued any arrest warrants.Prosecutors said in 2021 there was a reasonable basis to believe that violations had been committed on all sides, including by Israeli troops, Hamas militants and other armed Palestinian groups.What acts could violate war crimes law?New York-based Human Rights Watch cited as possible war crimes the deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate rocket attacks, and the taking of civilians as hostages by Palestinian armed groups, as well as the Israeli counter-strikes in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians.\"Deliberate killings of civilians, hostage-taking, and collective punishment are heinous crimes that have no justification,\" said Omar Shakir, the group\\'s Israel and Palestine director.The taking of hostages, murder and torture are explicitly banned under the Geneva Conventions, while Israel\\'s response could also be subject to a war crimes investigation. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant drew criticism from U.N. officials and human rights groups by announcing a tightened blockade to prevent food and fuel from reaching the Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million people.Do the Geneva Conventions apply?Israel has a right and duty to respond, US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday, adding that he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had discussed “how democracies like Israel and the United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law.”A siege can be considered a war crime if it targets civilians, rather than a legitimate means to undermine Hamas\\' military capabilities, or if found to be disproportionate.Attacks on military objectives have to be proportional under international law which means they must not lead to excessive loss of civilian life or damage to civilian objects in relation to the direct and concrete military advantage expected.Mr Nick Kaufman, a British-born Israeli defence lawyer at the ICC, cited the gruesome killings by Hamas militants of hundreds of revellers at a dance rave and civilians in several Kibbutz communities near the Gaza border as an obvious focus for a war crimes case.

       "  'Text': 'KHAN YOUNIS/TEL AVIV  -     Gazans desperate for an end to their suffering said on Monday they wanted the truce to be extended, while Israelis were divided between those who wanted an extension so all hostages could come home and others worried about giving in to Hamas demands.The truce was due to expire on Monday, and negotiators from Egypt, Qatar and the United States were trying to persuade Hamas and Israel to reach an agreement to prolong it.In Khan Younis, a town in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of people displaced from the north have sought refuge in tents and schools, a large crowd had gathered at a U.N. depot where sacks of flour were being distributed.Sabreen al-Najar said she had waited for several hours to get flour to feed her children, but the ration she had been given was barely enough to last two or three days.\"We want to go back (to our homes). We don\\'t want war at all,\" she said, calling on Arab countries to help Gaza. \"God willing the truce will be extended.\"Al-Najar said her family did not have enough food or clean water, and when it rained they got completely drenched in their makeshift shelter.Other displaced people talked about their difficulties with the cold and rain, the lack of food and power, the daily queues for basic goods, and their longing to return home. All of them wanted the truce to continue.\"What is this four-day truce? This is so unfair, what’s been done to us. What are we going to do in only four days? We’re getting by with candles. We don’t have batteries, gas, electricity, or water. We get water from faraway places,\" said Jumaa al-Araj, a man in a wheelchair.The war began when Hamas militants burst out of Gaza on Oct. 7 and rampaged through southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, including babies and children, and seizing more than 200 hostages.Israel responded with an all-out assault on Gaza which has killed 14,800 Palestinians, four in ten of them children under 18, according to health officials in the Hamas-controlled territory.WIDE RANGE OF VIEWS IN ISRAELOn the other side of the border, Israelis were focused on the fate of the hostages. A total of 58 have been released in three phases since Friday, with more expected to be freed on Monday out of 184 still being held in Gaza.\"We want all hostages back home now, so whatever it takes and as long as we keep on getting them back home, I want the ceasefire to continue,\" said community manager Arava Gerzon Raz, speaking on a square in Tel Aviv that has become a hub for families and supporters of the hostages.Ido Segev, an Intel employee, said he was optimistic the truce would be extended as long as Hamas continued handing over hostages.\"You strike deals when you have some mutual interest and as long as Hamas has an interest to get ceasefire because of military pressure or other reasons they will be paying for that, if you will, with hostages,\" he said.There were, however, dissonant voices who gave a flavour of the wide range of views on the conflict within Israeli society.Adam Sela, who runs a tourism company, said he was against the truce and thought Israel should have held out for a better deal in which all hostages were released.\"I think we\\'re being manoeuvred into a position which is favourable for them (Hamas), and like in all conflicts, if it’s favourable for one side, it’s unfavourable for the other side,\" he said. But Jerusalem resident Anat Errel felt very differently.\"I really hope that it will continue to be ceasefire because violence is not a solution for anything,\" she said, distinguishing between Hamas and civilians in Gaza.\"They (Hamas) need to be punished, but not all the other people in Gaza need to be punished,\" she said.

       "  'Title': 'Explainer-What is Hezbollah? The Lebanese group backing Hamas in its war with Israel',\n",
       "  'Text': 'BEIRUT  -     Lebanon\\'s Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israel across the border for days in the deadliest escalation since they fought a major war in 2006, threatening to expand a conflict between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas.Backed by Iran, Hezbollah has said it is ready to help when the time comes in the war between Israel and Hamas, which is also backed by Tehran. Sources said last week Hezbollah\\'s attacks so far had been designed to be contained and so avoid another major war.Israel\\'s defence minister said on Oct. 15 that Israel had no interest in waging war on its northern front, and that if Hezbollah restrained itself then Israel would also keep the situation along the border as it is.    WHAT ARE THE ORIGINS OF HEZBOLLAH?Iran\\'s Revolutionary Guards founded Hezbollah in 1982, the middle of Lebanon\\'s 1975-90 civil war. It was part of Iran\\'s effort to exports its 1979 Islamic Revolution around the region and fight Israeli forces after their 1982 invasion of Lebanon.Sharing Tehran\\'s Shi\\'ite Islamist ideology, Hezbollah recruited Lebanese Shi\\'ite Muslims. The group has risen from a shadowy faction to a heavily armed force with major sway over the Lebanese state. The United States, some Western governments and others deem it a terrorist organisation.HOW POWERFUL IS HEZBOLLAH\\'S MILITARY?While other groups disarmed after Lebanon\\'s civil war, Hezbollah kept its weapons to fight Israeli forces that were occupying the predominantly Shi\\'ite south of the country. Years of guerrilla warfare led Israel to withdraw in 2000.Hezbollah demonstrated its military advances in 2006 during a five-week war with Israel, which erupted after it crossed into Israel, kidnapping two soldiers and killing others. Hezbollah fired thousands of rockets into Israel during the conflict, in which 1,200 people were killed in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 158 Israelis were killed, most of them soldiers.Hezbollah\\'s military power grew after it deployed into Syria, another of Iran\\'s allies in the region, to help President Bashar al-Assad fight mostly Sunni Muslim rebels.Hezbollah boasts weapons including precision rockets and drones, and says it can hit all parts of Israel. In 2021, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the group had 100,000 fighters.  Iran gives Hezbollah weapons and money. The United States estimates Iran has allocated it hundreds of millions of dollars annually in recent years.WHAT\\'S ITS ROLE IN THE ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT SO FAR?Hezbollah has deep ties to Hamas, which controls Gaza, and Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian faction backed by Iran.Hezbollah said it was in \"direct contact with the leadership of the Palestinian resistance\" on Oct. 7, the day Hamas militants carried out an unprecedented assault from Gaza into Israel, killing 1,300 people. In Israel\\'s intensive air strikes on Gaza in response, more than 2,750 people have been killed.Since Oct. 7, Hezbollah has exchanged cross-border fire with Israel numerous times. Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which both have a presence in Lebanon, have mounted attacks on Israel from Lebanon for the first time, including an Oct. 10 cross-border infiltration into Israel by Islamic Jihad.Tzachi Hanegbi, the national security adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Oct. 14 that the hostilities appeared to be restrained. Hanegbi warned Hezbollah not to take action that could lead to Lebanon\\'s \"destruction\".WHAT REGIONAL SWAY DOES HEZBOLLAH HAVE?Hezbollah has been a source of inspiration and support for other Iranian-backed groups across the Middle East. It has trained armed groups in Iraq and taken part in fighting there.Saudi Arabia says Hezbollah has also fought in support of the Iran-allied Houthis in Yemen. Hezbollah denies this. WHAT IS HEZBOLLAH\\'S ROLE IN LEBANON?Hezbollah\\'s influence is underpinned by its sophisticated arsenal and the support of many Lebanese Shi\\'ites who say the group defends Lebanon from Israel.Lebanese parties opposed to Hezbollah say the group has undermined the state and accuse it of unilaterally dragging Lebanon into armed conflicts. Hezbollah has ministers in government and lawmakers in parliament.It entered Lebanese politics more prominently in 2005 after Syria withdrew forces from Lebanon following the killing of former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri, who symbolised Saudi influence in the country.A U.N.-backed court convicted three Hezbollah members in absentia over the assassination. Hezbollah denies any role, describing the court as a tool of its enemies.In 2008, a power struggle between Hezbollah and its Lebanese political adversaries, who had the backing of the West and Saudi Arabia, spiralled into a brief conflict. Hezbollah fighters took over parts of Beirut after the government vowed to take action against the group\\'s military communications network.In 2016, Hezbollah-allied Christian politician Michel Aoun became president - in Lebanon\\'s sectarian political system the presidency is held by a Maronite Christian.Two years later, Hezbollah and its allies won a parliamentary majority. This majority was lost in 2022, but the group continued to exercise major political sway.The group campaigned against a judge investigating the 2020 Beirut port explosion, which devastated swathes of the capital, after he sought to question Hezbollah\\'s allies. The standoff prompted deadly clashes in Beirut in 2021.HAS HEZBOLLAH BEEN ACCUSED OF ATTACKS ON WESTERN TARGETS?Lebanese security officials and Western intelligence have said groups that were linked to Hezbollah carried out suicide attacks on Western embassies and targets and kidnapped Westerners in the 1980s. One group, Islamic Jihad, which is not related to the Palestinian organisation, was thought to be led by Imad Moughniyah, a top Hezbollah commander who was killed in a car bomb in Syria in 2008.The United States holds Hezbollah responsible for a suicide bombing that destroyed U.S. Marine headquarters in Beirut in 1983, killing 241 servicemen, and a suicide attack the same year on the U.S. embassy. A suicide bombing also hit a French barracks in Beirut in 1983, killing 58 French paratroopers.    Referring to those attacks and hostage-taking, Hezbollah leader Nasrallah said in a 2022 interview that they were carried out by small groups not linked to Hezbollah.WHAT DO WESTERN GOVERNMENTS OR OTHERS SAY ABOUT THE GROUP?Western countries including the United States designate Hezbollah a terrorist organisation. So do U.S.-allied Gulf Arab states including Saudi Arabia.The European Union classifies Hezbollah\\'s military wing as a terrorist group, but not its political wing.Argentina blames Hezbollah and Iran for the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires in which 85 people were killed, and for a 1992 attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires that killed 29 people. Iran and Hezbollah both deny responsibility. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Palestinian Americans fundraise for Gaza, as aid groups receive record donations',\n",
       "  'Text': 'NEW YORK – Palestinian Americans and aid groups in the United States are raising funds for Gaza, which faces a deepening humanitarian crisis as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth week – but they have as yet limited ability to get supplies into the besieged enclave.Aid organisations that serve civilians in Gaza say they are receiving record amounts of donations in a sign of public support for relief efforts, even as a growing stock of supplies remains stalled at Egypt’s Rafah border crossing.In the Gaza Strip, where 2.3 million people live, civilians are in dire need of clean water, food and medicine, emergency medics say. Half of Gaza’s population was already living in poverty before the crisis.“We’ve seen a significant increase in donations, unlike (anything) we’ve ever seen before,” said Mr Steve Sosebee, president of the US-based Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which has a staff headcount of 40 in Gaza, who provide medical support.He said the fund, which usually has an annual budget of around US$12 million (S$16.45 million), had raised US$15 million in just 10 days.However, with a web of political and logistical obstacles on getting aid in, much of the money and supplies intended for Gaza is in limbo, forcing aid groups to wait as they amass truckloads of goods.Hamas militants burst over the Gaza border and rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people and taking 229 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.In response, Israel launched its most intense air bombardment campaign on the tiny enclave, along with a “total siege”, banning food, water and fuel imports.Aid groups say they are building up supplies in hopes of eventually getting them through to civilians in Gaza, nearly half of whom are children.There has been “a five-fold increase in the total number of donors versus typical past emergencies”, said Mr Derek Madsen, chief development\\xa0officer of Anera, a non-partisan emergency relief group for refugees throughout the Middle East.The organisation, which maintains the privacy of individual donors, said it had recently received the largest single donation from an individual in its 55-year history.The majority of support comes from donors based in the US, he added, with individual donations averaging around US$138. The efforts mirror those of Jewish groups in the US and Canada, who also fundraised millions for Israel.Anera was using the last of its stocks this week to distribute meals and vegetable parcels in Gaza. Its staff of 12, like everyone in Gaza, were facing “unbelievable, unimaginable trauma”, he said.Glued to the televisionIn Ann Arbor, Michigan, Ms Rabia Shafie, national director of the Palestine Aid Society, said her group was speaking to student and Muslim groups on local university campuses and community centres to spread awareness and raise donations for the Red Crescent and UNRWA, the United Nations aid agency that serves Palestinian refugees.“The money is needed to help people survive at this point of time. Medical support is so essential,” she said.“People are glued to the television... watching the news moment to moment, and very stressed out over the situation,” said Ms Rabia, adding that it was difficult as a Palestinian American to watch “the massacre and injustice done to our people back home”.Hamas-governed Gaza is one of the most densely packed places on Earth, and its medical authorities say over 8,000 Palestinians have been killed since air strikes began, including more than 3,000 children.Mr Madsen called for a ceasefire and establishment of a humanitarian corridor “so that people literally do not starve to death, literally do not die of dehydration”.Last week, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, home to one of New York’s largest Muslim and Arab communities, hundreds of protesters called for a ceasefire with signs written in Arabic, Spanish, Hebrew and Korean.In Clifton, New Jersey, the Palestinian American Community Centre’s priorities are calling for US officials to support a ceasefire, and the hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza, said Ms Basma Bsharat, the education director of the centre.The centre has also been collecting cash donations to send on to UNRWA. It has asked people not to donate supplies, which it has no easy way of sending to those in need in Gaza.Last week, a woman came to the centre anyway, hauling bags filled with goods.  “We didn’t know how to say no,” said Ms Basma. “She was like, I just want to do something. I just want to help somehow.”“It’s a very difficult time, and the fact that we do see the support coming in it, it gives some relief,” she said. “It gives some kind of solace.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': \"Hamas' cash-to-crypto global finance maze in Israel's sights\",\n",
       "  'Text': 'LONDON/DUBAI  -     Palestinian militant group Hamas uses a global financing network to funnel support from charities and friendly nations, passing cash through Gaza tunnels or using cryptocurrencies to bypass international sanctions, according to experts and officials.However, Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, will face even more obstacles accessing funds after the rampage by the group\\'s gunmen that killed hundreds of Israelis, mainly civilians. Israel has responded with the heaviest bombardment of Gaza in 75 years of conflict.Earlier this week, Israeli police said they froze a Barclays bank account the authorities said was linked to Hamas fundraising and blocked cryptocurrency accounts used to gather donations, without specifying how many accounts or the value of the assets.The move provided a glimpse of a complex financial web, some legitimate, much hidden, that underpins Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, and its government in the Gaza Strip, which it has run since 2007.Matthew Levitt, a former U.S. official specialised in counterterrorism, estimated the bulk of Hamas\\' budget of more than $300 million came from taxes on business, as well as from countries including Iran and Qatar or charities.Last February, the State Department said that Hamas raises funds in other Gulf countries and gets donations from Palestinians, other expatriates and its own charities.Reuters was unable to reach Hamas officials for comment for this story. In the past, Hamas has said financial restrictions placed on its donors were an attempt to neutralise legitimate resistance against Israel.Hamas, sanctioned as a terrorist organization by the United States and countries such as Britain, had increasingly used cryptocurrencies, credit cards or contrived trade deals to avoid mounting international restrictions, Levitt said.\"Hamas has been one of the more successful users of crypto for the financing\\xa0of terrorism,\" said Tom Robinson, co-founder of blockchain research firm Elliptic.However, this year Hamas said it would back away from crypto, after a spate of losses. Cryptocurrency\\'s ledger system can make such transactions traceable.Blockchain researchers TRM Labs said this week in a research note that crypto fundraising has previously increased following rounds of violence involving Hamas. After fighting in May 2021, Hamas-controlled crypto addresses received more than $400,000, TRM Labs said.However, since last weekend\\'s violence, prominent Hamas-linked support groups had moved just a few thousands dollars through crypto, TRM noted.\"One likely reason for the low donation volume is that Israeli authorities are targeting them immediately,\" TRM said, adding that Israel had seized cryptocurrency worth \"tens of millions of dollars\" from Hamas-linked addresses in recent years.Between Dec. 2021 and April this year, Israel seized almost 190 crypto accounts it said were linked to Hamas.SHIPS AND SHELLSWhether through crypto or other means, Hamas\\' allies have found ways to get money to Gaza. The U.S. State Department has said that Iran provides up to $100 million annually in support to Palestinian groups including Hamas, and has cited methods of moving the money through shell companies, shipping transactions and precious metals.  Iranian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.By last year, Hamas had established a secret network of companies managing $500 million of investments in companies from Turkey to Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Treasury has said, announcing sanctions on the firms in May, 2022.Israel has long accused Iran\\'s clerical rulers of stoking violence by supplying arms to Hamas. Tehran, which does not recognise Israel, says it gives moral and financial support to the group.Backing the Palestinian cause has been a pillar of the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution and a way for the country to fashion itself as a leader of the Muslim world.     Gas-rich Qatar too has paid hundreds of millions of dollars to Gaza since 2014, at one point spending $30 million per month to help operate the enclave\\'s sole power plant and to support needy families and public servants in the Hamas-run government. \"Qatari aid provides 100 dollars to the poorest Palestinian families and extends the period of electricity during a day in Gaza,\" a Qatari official said in response to a request for government comment, adding that it had helped \"maintain stability and quality of life for ... Palestinian families\".Qatar walks a foreign policy tightrope, hosting the region\\'s largest U.S. military base, the Taliban and other groups, often allowing it to mediate.CASH RULESQatar\\'s funding for Gaza actually passes through Israel, a source familiar with the process said. The funds are transferred electronically from Qatar to Israel. Israeli and U.N. officials hand-carry cash over the border to Gaza.The cash is distributed directly to needy families and public servants in Gaza and each family or individual must sign next to their name that they\\'ve received the cash. One copy of that sheet goes to Israel, one goes to the UN and one goes to Qatar.\"Qatari aid to the Gaza Strip is fully coordinated with Israel, the UN and the U.S.,\" the Qatari government official said.In recent years, Qatar bought fuel from Israel for Gaza\\'s sole power station. It also sent Egyptian fuel that Hamas can resell, using the proceeds for salaries. Stephen Reimer of the think tank, Royal United Services Institute, predicted fresh attempts to fully restrict the group\\'s access to formal financial channels would have limited success. \"Their financing tactics have grown to circumvent these.\" REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': \"White House suggests 'pauses' in Israel-Hamas conflict to get people out\",\n",
       "  'Text': 'WASHINGTON  -The White House on Thursday said it was exploring a series of pauses in the Israel-Hamas conflict to help people safely exit Gaza and allow humanitarian aid to get in, but reiterated its opposition to a full ceasefire.National security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that such pauses should be temporary and localized, and insisted they would not stop Israel from defending itself.\"What we\\'re trying to do is explore the idea of as many pauses as might be necessary to continue to get aid out and to continue to work to get people out safely, including hostages,\" he told reporters at a regular White House briefing. President Joe Biden spoke on Wednesday about the need for a pause to provide time for the release of hostages held by Hamas, but has ruled out calling for a full ceasefire.His fellow Democrat, Senator Dick Durbin, on Thursday told CNN it was time for a ceasefire, while Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, called for a humanitarian pause to allow critical aid to reach civilians.United Nations experts are also urging a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, saying time is running out for Palestinian people there who find themselves at \"grave risk of genocide.\"Israel says it is aiming its attacks at Hamas, not civilians, and accuses the group of using them as human shields.Nearly four weeks of Israeli bombardment against the Gaza Strip in retaliation for deadly attacks by Hamas gunmen in southern Israel on Oct. 7 have killed at least 9,061 people, made up of a majority of women and children, health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave say.The White House on Thursday said 79 of its citizens have left the Gaza Strip in the two days since a crossing opened to Egypt, and it hoped more could be released in coming days, but conceded the situation remained \"fluid.\"Kirby told reporters that 55 more aid trucks were expected to enter Gaza on Thursday, bringing the total to more than 220, but said increasing aid remained a top priority for Biden.He said the United States was speaking with Israel daily and urging it to avoid civilian casualties. He noted that U.S. military officers had traveled to Israel to share lessons learned in past urban conflicts but they had since returned home, and Washington was not helping Israel with its targeting.\"There are things you can do from the ground that you can\\'t do from the air, particularly if you have good intelligence,\" he said, without elaborating.\"We\\'re doing everything we can to work with our Israeli counterparts to try to minimize the risk of civilian deaths and collateral damage,\" Kirby said. \"We are giving them the tools, including perspective and advice but also weapons, to be able to conduct these operations in the most efficient way possible, and in a way that minimizes civilian harm.\"Kirby said the scope of Israel\\'s operations showed \"they are making efforts to try to minimize civilian casualties,\" adding it was clear that some casualties were still occurring.Asked if the United States bore responsibility for civilian deaths if it was providing such weapons, Kirby insisted that Washington was not \"making the targeting decisions.\" REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Aid supplies to Gaza halted again, UN says starvation imminent   ',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM – United Nations aid deliveries to Gaza were suspended again on Nov 17 due to shortages of fuel and a communications shutdown, deepening the misery of thousands of hungry and homeless Palestinians as Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the enclave. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said civilians faced the “immediate possibility of starvation” due to the lack of food supplies. Palestinian news agency Wafa said a number of Palestinians were killed and others injured in an Israeli strike that hit a group of displaced people near the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt – the transit point for aid. Al Jazeera TV cited sources as saying that nine people were killed in the strike. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the reported strike, and Reuters could not verify it.In other developments, Israel said its troops had found a tunnel shaft used by Hamas at Al-Shifa Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip.The hospital, packed with patients and displaced people and struggling to keep operating, has been a major focus of global concern this week. Israel says Hamas has stored weapons and ammunition and is holding hostages in a network of tunnels under hospitals like Shifa, using patients and people taking shelter there as human shields. Hamas denies this.With the war about to enter its seventh week, there is no sign of any let-up despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.The conflict was triggered by a cross-border raid by Hamas militants on Oct 7 that killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, in the deadliest day in the state’s 75-year-history.More than 11,500 Palestinians, at least 4,700 of them children, have now been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military assault on Hamas-ruled Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry – a toll that far surpasses previous bouts of conflict in recent years.Israel has vowed to wipe out the militant group. Whole neighbourhoods of Gaza have been flattened in air and artillery strikes, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, and the humanitarian situation is catastrophic, aid agencies say.Trucks suspendedThe UN said there would be no cross-border aid operation on Nov 17 due to fuel shortages and a communication shutdown.  For a second consecutive day on Nov 16, no aid lorries arrived in Gaza due to lack of fuel for distributing relief.WFP executive director Cindy McCain said nearly the entire population was in desperate need of food assistance.“Supplies of food and water are practically non-existent in Gaza and only a fraction of what is needed is arriving through the borders,” she said in a statement.“With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,” Ms McCain said.A UN human rights official said Israel must allow water and fuel into Gaza to restart the water supply network.“Every hour that passes with Israel preventing the provision of safe drinking water in the Gaza Strip, in brazen breach of international law, puts Gazans at risk of dying of thirst and diseases,” Mr Pedro Arrojo-Agudo said.The World Health Organisation on Nov 17 said it was very worried about the spread of disease in Gaza, citing more than 70,000 reported cases of acute respiratory infections and over 44,000 cases of diarrhoea, far more than expected.The Israeli military’s chief of staff said Israel was close to destroying Hamas’ military system in the northern Gaza Strip, and there were signs the army was taking its campaign to other parts of the coastal enclave of 2.3 million people.Israel accused Hamas of preventing people from heading to the south of the Gaza Strip, which the militant group denied.The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of Al-Shifa, Gaza’s biggest hospital.The video, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a deep hole in the ground, littered with and surrounded by concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.The army said its troops also found a vehicle in the hospital containing a large number of weapons.Reuters journalists have been unable to reach anyone inside Al-Shifa Hospital for more than 24 hours.Hamas on Nov 16 said claims by the United States that the group uses Shifa for military purposes were “a repetition of a blatantly false narrative, demonstrated by the weak and ridiculous performances of the occupation army spokesman”. Israeli officials said Hamas held some of the 240 hostages taken by gunmen on Oct 7 in the hospital complex.On Nov 17 the Israeli military said soldiers retrieved the body of a female soldier who had been held captive in a building near Shifa.The military confirmed her death on Nov 14 after Hamas issued a video of her alive, followed by images of what it said was her body after she was killed in an Israeli strike.On Nov 16, troops recovered the body of another woman hostage, also in a building near Shifa.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Hamas’ Al-Quds Brigades said they had engaged Israeli forces for several hours in the city of Jenin overnight into Nov 17, unleashing a “torrent of fire” and laying ambushes with explosives.Israel’s military said warplanes struck militants in Jenin who had opened fire on Israeli soldiers. It said at least five of the militants were killed.At least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the Oct 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The violence there has underscored fears that the territory, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, could spiral out of control in tandem with the conflict in Gaza. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Singapore “deeply regrets” the impact of Israel’s military operations on Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Nov 17.“We strongly urge Israel to do its utmost to protect all civilians and medical facilities in Gaza. We urge all parties to comply fully with international humanitarian law,” it said in a statement.“Civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, should be protected.”\\xa0MFA also said that Hamas should not use these premises for military purposes or civilians as human shields, and reiterated its call for the immediate and safe release of civilian hostages in Gaza.On Nov 15, Israeli troops entered Al-Shifa, Gaza’s biggest hospital, following a days-long siege that has caused global alarm over the fate of civilians trapped inside. Reuters quoted a Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson as saying that there was no water, food or baby milk in the hospital, which was packed with 650 patients and about 7,000 people displaced by weeks of Israeli air strikes and artillery bombardments. MFA also said that Singapore remains deeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Palestinian civilians have borne the brunt of Israel’s weeks-long military campaign in retaliation for an Oct 7 attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel also says that Hamas took more than 240 hostages. Singapore welcomed the adoption of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2712, which calls for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors in Gaza. The resolution was adopted by the Security Council on Wednesday, with 12 members voting in favour, none against and three abstentions (Russia, Britain and the United States). “Every effort must be made for the immediate, safe and unhindered provision of humanitarian aid to affected civilians throughout Gaza,” MFA added. The Al-Shifa Hospital has become the main target of Israel’s ground operation.The Israeli military has claimed that Hamas has its headquarters in tunnels beneath the facility, which the Palestinian militant group denies. MFA said that Singapore will continue to work closely with its humanitarian partners to offer additional assistance and support to the Palestinian people. Reuters reported that Gaza health authorities deemed reliable by the UN had said that at least 11,500 people have been confirmed killed, more than 4,700 of them children, in the Israeli bombardment and ground invasion.Since the war began, more than two-thirds of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have fled their homes. There have been limited deliveries of humanitarian relief crossing from Egypt into Gaza since Oct 21.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Hamas, Israel agree deal for release of 50 hostages in exchange for 4-day truce',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Israel and Hamas agreed on Nov 22 to a ceasefire for at least four days to let in aid and allow the release of at least 50 hostages held by Hamas in exchange for some 150 Palestinians jailed in Israel.The first truce in a brutal near seven-week-old war, reached after mediation by Qatar, was hailed around the world as a sign of progress that could ease the suffering of civilians in the Gaza Strip and bring more Israeli hostages home. Israel said the ceasefire could be extended further, as long as more hostages were freed.Hamas is believed to be holding more than 200 hostages, taken when its fighters attacked southern Israel on Oct 7. Some 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli tallies.The first hostages are expected to go free on Nov 23.A statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said 50 women and children would be released over four days at a rate of at least 10 each day.  Beyond that, the truce could be extended, as long as an additional 10 hostages are freed per day.Mr Netanyahu made no mention of the release of Palestinian detainees, but Israel’s Justice Ministry published a list of 300 names of Palestinian prisoners who could be freed.“Israel’s government is committed to return all the hostages home. Tonight, it approved the proposed deal as a first stage to achieving this goal,” said Mr Netanyahu.Hamas said the 50 hostages would be released in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children who are held in Israeli jails. The truce will also allow hundreds of humanitarian, medical and fuel aid trucks to enter all parts of Gaza, the group said in a statement.Israel has committed not to attack or arrest anyone in all parts of Gaza during the truce period, it added.Qatar’s chief negotiator, Minister of State at the Foreign Ministry Mohammed Al-Khulaifi, told Reuters that the truce meant there would be “no attack whatsoever. No military movements, no expansion, nothing”. Qatar hopes the deal “will be a seed to a bigger agreement and a permanent cease of fire, and that’s our intention”, he said.There was no let-up in fighting, pending the start of the truce. As morning broke on Nov 22, smoke from explosions could be seen rising above northern Gaza in live Reuters video footage from across the fence.Israel’s military released footage of soldiers shooting in narrow alleyways and said it had carried out air strikes. It said its “forces continue to operate within the Strip’s territory to destroy terrorist infrastructure, eliminate terrorists and locate weaponry”.At least 14,000 people have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory action, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza. About two-thirds of the coastal enclave’s 2.3 million people are homeless.Both Israel and Hamas said the truce would not halt their broader missions.“We are at war, and we will continue the war until we achieve all our goals. To destroy Hamas, return all our hostages, and ensure that no entity in Gaza can threaten Israel,” Mr Netanyahu said in a recorded message.Hamas said in its statement: “As we announce the striking of a truce agreement, we affirm that our fingers remain on the trigger, and our victorious fighters will remain on the lookout to defend our people and defeat the occupation.”Still, there was some hope of a step towards broader peace.“We hope the truce will happen, and there will be good solutions, and we hope people will live peacefully, return to their homes and workplaces with stability,” said Mr Abu Jihad Shameya, who had taken refuge in the main southern city of Khan Younis after fleeing northern Gaza.“May God not prolong this hardship,” he said.Release to begin on Nov 23United States President Joe Biden said he welcomed the deal. “Today’s deal should bring home additional American hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released,” he said in a statement.Three Americans, including a three-year-old girl whose parents were among those killed during the Oct 7 attack, are expected to be among the hostages to be released, a senior US official said.In addition to Israeli citizens, more than half the hostages hold foreign and dual citizenship from some 40 countries. These include Thailand, Britain, France, Argentina and Chile, Israel’s government has said.Ms Kamelia Hoter Ishay, the grandmother of 13-year-old Gali Tarshansky, who is believed to be held in Gaza, said she would not believe reports of a deal until she gets a call that the teenager was freed.“And then I’ll know that it’s really over, and I can breathe a sigh of relief and say that’s it, it’s over,” she said.Mr Qadura Fares, head of the Commission for Prisoners’ Affairs in the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority, told Reuters that among the more than 7,800 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel were about 85 women and 350 minors. Most were detained without charges or for incidents such as hurling rocks at Israeli soldiers, not for launching militant attacks, he said.The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan\\xa0welcomed the temporary truce.They told reporters in London that the agreement should also ultimately lead to a resumption of talks for a two-state solution.Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, said the humanitarian aid should be sustained and expanded, and it should not later become contingent on further hostage releases.“Whatever humanitarian access now increases as a result of this hostage deal must remain in place and must be built upon,” he said.“There must, at no point, be a reduction in this access based on progress for further release of hostages... Punishing the civilian population of Gaza for the holding of those hostages is absolutely not acceptable.”Hospital ordered to evacuateAs attention focused on the hostage release deal, fighting on the ground raged on.In the occupied West Bank on Nov 22, an Israeli drone strike killed five Palestinians and wounded others in the Tolkurm camp, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.Mr Mounir Al-Barsh, director-general of Gaza’s Health Ministry, told Al Jazeera TV that the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza City. Israel said militants are operating from the facility and threatened to act against them within four hours, he said.Hospitals – including Gaza’s biggest, Al-Shifa – have been rendered virtually inoperable by the war and shortages of critical supplies. Israel claims that Hamas conceals military command posts and fighters within them, a claim that Hamas and hospital staff deny.On Nov 21, Israel also said that its forces had encircled the Jabalia refugee camp, a major urban flashpoint and Hamas militant stronghold.According to the United Nations, most Palestinians in Gaza are registered as refugees because they or their ancestors were displaced by the 1948 war of Israel’s creation.Wafa said 33 people were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli air strike on parts of Jabalia, a congested urban extension of Gaza City where Hamas has been battling advancing Israeli armoured forces.In southern Gaza, Hamas-affiliated media said 10 people were killed and 22 injured by an Israeli air strike on an apartment in Khan Younis.

       "  'Title': 'Israel PM Netanyahu rejects Gaza ceasefire, says it amounts to ‘surrendering to Hamas’',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday a ceasefire in the Israel’s war against Hamas “will not happen”, as the United Nations warned not enough aid was coming in to meet “unprecedented humanitarian needs”.Israeli ground forces fought inside the Gaza Strip and air strikes pounded the besieged Hamas-run Palestinian territory in response to the Oct 7 attack – the deadliest in Israel’s history.The intensifying military operations have sharply heightened fears for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza, where the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says more than 8,300 have been killed.In a briefing to foreign press, Mr Netanyahu said a ceasefire would amount to surrendering to Hamas, whose gunmen killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages, according to the latest Israeli figures.“Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen,” he said, vowing Israel will “fight until this battle is won”.The United States, Israel’s ally, also objected to a ceasefire.“We do not believe that a ceasefire is the right answer right now,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, adding that “pauses” to get aid into Gaza should be considered instead.As Israeli forces battled Hamas militants inside the narrow Palestinian territory and sent tanks to the outskirts of Gaza City, concern has surged about the widening humanitarian crisis.Mr Kirby said Washington was “confident” of increasing the number of aid trucks to Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt to around 100 a day.Limited aid has entered Gaza from Egypt under a US-brokered deal, but its volume has fallen far short of the hundreds of trucks a day aid agencies say are needed.Mr Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, called for the Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs,” he said.Israeli tanks on Gaza highway The Hamas attack set off the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, marked by weeks of withering aerial bombardment and three continuous nights of ground operations centred on northern Gaza, which Israel has told civilians to evacuate.Columns of Israeli tanks and armoured bulldozers were seen churning through the sand, and snipers took positions inside emptied residential buildings, in footage released by the army.Dozens of tanks advanced for more than an hour into the southern fringes of Gaza City and blocked the main north-south highway, “firing at any vehicle that tries to go on it”, an eyewitness told AFP by phone.Air strikes also cratered the road and brought down buildings, residents said, before the tanks withdrew.The Israeli ground forces were supported by heavy fire from the air and artillery, with the army striking more than 600 targets within 24 hours, up from 450 reported by the military a day earlier.Hamas said it had fired anti-tank missiles at two Israeli armoured vehicles and that “blows delivered by the resistance have prevented” Israeli troops from establishing a presence in Gaza.The Israeli military also said a woman soldier was rescued from captivity after an operation in the Hamas-run territory. The release of Ms Ori Megidish was “secured during a ground operation”, the army said, adding that she had been “medically checked” and was “doing well”.Mr Netanyahu said the international community must demand the captives remaining in Gaza “be freed immediately, unconditionally”.Hamas released a video of what it said were three women hostages, seated against a tile wall, although the time and place of the recording could not be verified.One called in an agitated tone for Mr Netanyahu to agree to Hamas’ proposed exchange of the hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Mr Netanyahu decried the clip as “cruel psychological propaganda”.‘Bombing followed us’ The more than 230 hostages – aged between a few months and above 80 – are believed to be held in a network of underground tunnels where Hamas has hid its military infrastructure from Israeli surveillance and air attacks.Israel confirmed the death of one of those missing – German-Israeli Shani Louk, 23, who was captured by Hamas when its gunmen stormed a desert music festival.Fear and desperation have spiralled in Gaza, under weeks of siege that have cut off water, food, fuel and other essentials.Internet access was severed on Friday but restored on Sunday following US pressure, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.“We made clear to the government of Israel over the weekend that communications networks needed to be restored,” he said on Monday. “It is about ensuring that vital information flows, humanitarian coordination continues and families can stay in touch.”The UN reported on Sunday that “thousands of people” had ransacked aid warehouses in Gaza.Donkey carts were lining up to load water, as safe drinking water has become scarce in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.According to the UN, all 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders – despite sheltering thousands of patients and about 117,000 displaced people.“We were displaced from our homes to the hospital,” Gaza City resident Ashraf al-Muzani, 38, said from Al-Quds hospital where he and his family have sheltered for a week. “The bombing followed us,” he added. “We haven’t been able to sleep and our children are so frightened.”‘Highest’ UN death toll Mr Lazzarini said 64 of his colleagues had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, “the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict in such a short time”.Anti-Israel anger has flared across the region and beyond.In Russia’s Muslim-majority Dagestan, police said they had arrested 60 people after a crowd stormed an airport on Sunday to attack passengers arriving from Tel Aviv.And Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the US of being responsible for what he called “deadly chaos” unfolding in the Middle East.Washington has warned Israel’s enemies – in particular Iran-allied groups – not to become more fully involved after a series of attacks across the region. Israel’s military has struck targets in Syria and traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told AFP he was “doing my duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war”.Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank where health officials say about 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire and in settler attacks since the Gaza war started.

       "  'Title': 'Israel-Hamas war won’t affect Paris 2024 Olympic Games security plans: Tony Estanguet',\n",
       "  'Text': 'MUMBAI – The war between Israel and militant group Hamas will not affect the security plans for 2024 Olympics, the chief of the Paris Games organising committee said on Monday.There have been protests linked to the Middle East conflict recently, with France being home to Europe’s largest Muslim and Jewish communities. It was put on its highest security alert on Friday after a teacher was killed in an Islamist attack.French President Emmanuel Macron ordered the deployment of up to 7,000 soldiers for increased security patrols, as bomb alerts forced the evacuation of the Louvre Museum and Palace of Versailles. Security at the Belgian border was also stepped up on Tuesday after a shooting incident in Brussels before a Euro 2024 qualifier between Belgium and Sweden a day earlier.Belgian police on Tuesday shot dead a 45-year-old Tunisian who was suspected of killing two Swedes heading to the match, which was abandoned at half-time.Macron on Tuesday denounced hostage-taking as an “ignominy” after Hamas aired a video of a Franco-Israeli woman it kidnapped.The Elysee presidential palace said Macron “calls for her immediate and unconditional release”, adding: “France is fully mobilised and is working with its partners to free French hostages held by Hamas”.“We will not change our plans with what is happening at the moment because since the beginning we are at the best level in terms of security with Paris 2024,” said Tony Estanguet, the president of the organising committee for the July 26-Aug 11 Games.“We anticipated a lot what we need. From the year 2020, we know very carefully how many people we need venue by venue, day by day and we continue to work with the public authorities to guarantee the security.“So again, I’m very confident because there is a strong commitment coming from our partners to guarantee the security.”French police used tear gas and water cannon to break up a banned rally in support of Palestinian people in Paris recently, as Mr Macron urged the French to remain united and refrain from bringing the Israel-Hamas conflict home.The country has been targeted by a series of terrorist attacks over the years, the worst being a simultaneous assault by gunmen and suicide bombers on entertainment venues and cafes in Paris in November 2015.For the 2024 Olympics, France will deploy some 35,000 security agents and the military to secure the opening ceremony alone, a river parade through the heart of Paris, from threats including drone strikes.Hundreds of thousands of spectators are expected to line the Seine river along the 6km route to watch the delegations sail in a flotilla of boats, from the Austerlitz Bridge to the foot of the Eiffel Tower, in the first Olympic opening ceremony of this size staged outside a stadium.“From the beginning of the journey, security is really a part of the project,” Estanguet said after a Paris 2024 presentation at the International Olympic Committee meeting in Mumbai.“We had a terrorist attack in 2015 and it was in the middle of the beginning of this project. So from the beginning, I think the public authorities with Paris 2024 set security as the No. 1 priority in the success of the Games.” Los Angeles 2028 chairman Casey Wasserman on Monday said he hoped the Olympics could be a “beacon of light and hope” for the world, as he lamented the conflict in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. Wasserman, citing the deaths of 11 Israelis killed by Palestinian gunmen at the 1972 Munich Games, added: “Unfortunately, the Olympics are not immune to the world we live in.“At its worst, it is a platform for hate to express itself on the stage and we will always remember the 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team who were taken hostage and murdered in Munich.“But at its best, it is an opportunity for sport to show the world a better path with peace and unity, and we will always remember the triumph of Jesse Owens in the face of unspeakable evil,” he said.Owens, an African-American track and field athlete, won four gold medals at the Berlin Olympics in 1936, when Germany was under the Nazi regime.

       "  'Title': 'Palestinian envoy urges China to help end Israel-Hamas war',\n",
       "  'Text': 'BEIJING – The Palestinian envoy to China called for Beijing to play a role in ending the Israel-Hamas war amid concerns of a wider conflict and rising humanitarian toll. “We would like to have China on board with all other players who can really put an end to this,” Ambassador Fariz Mehdawi told Bloomberg TV in an interview on Monday. He cited moves currently under way by Western officials to try to prevent a spillover, and called on Beijing to play its part, although he did not specify how. “We need to stop what’s going on. People are dying.”The United States and its allies are ratcheting up efforts to prevent a further escalation of the Israel-Hamas war, with President Joe Biden mulling over a trip to Israel. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is back in Israel for a second time since the Oct 7 attacks by Hamas, following talks with Arab leaders.Mr Mehdawi’s comments are the latest in a chorus of voices looking for Beijing to step up its efforts at peacemaking.Speaking with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last Saturday, Mr Blinken urged China to use its influence to prevent other actors from entering the conflict.The Israeli ambassador to China previously called on Beijing to leverage its close relationship with Iran to rein in Hamas, which the European Union and the US have designated a terrorist organisation.Mr Mehdawi downplayed the role of Iran, suggesting “the problem is at home here inside Palestine, inside Israel”.The US has been particularly concerned about Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia group in Lebanon, opening an additional front in the war on Israel’s northern border.Earlier, the US said it held talks with Iran through back channels and warned Teheran against escalating the conflict.China has close relations with Iran, and assisted Teheran in brokering a landmark diplomatic detente with Saudi Arabia earlier in 2023.“Israel’s actions have gone beyond self-defence and it should heed the call of the international community and the Secretary-General of the United Nations to stop its collective punishment of the people in Gaza,” Foreign Minister Wang said during a phone conversation with his Saudi Arabian counterpart, according to a readout from the official Xinhua News Agency.\\xa0Residents in Gaza are bracing themselves for a potential ground assault by the Israel Defence Forces. The United Nations said last Friday that the military had told its staff on the ground that all residents of northern Gaza – roughly half the territory’s population of over two million people – had until midnight to relocate south.It called the task “impossible”.

       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM  -     A senior Microsoft Israel official expressed concern for the future of Israel\\'s high tech sector due to the country\\'s war with Islamist group Hamas, warning multinational companies may close research and development activities.Tomer Simon, chief scientist at Microsoft Israel\\'s R&D Center, said he expressed his concerns in a letter to Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel\\'s head of the National Security Council, but never received a reply.As a result, Simon published his letter in the Calcalist financial daily on Wednesday, saying it was his personal opinion and not on behalf of Microsoft, one of hundreds of multinationals operating in Israel.\"The country must create a positive horizon so that multinational companies continue to grow,\" Simon said, noting that for every tech job, there were five more created that drive Israel\\'s economy. \"There is a great danger here. Israel cannot return to just producing oranges. Without high-tech we will return to being a third world economy.\"The prime minister\\'s office did not immediately comment to Reuters.Simon, who also acknowledged the human cost of the war, called on leaders to send a clear message to international partners and the global business community that Israel was committed to a prosperous and stable future. Hundreds of thousands of army reservists have been called up, leaving a gaping hole in manpower and disrupting supply chains from seaports to supermarkets.\"The war has created a substantial vacuum in the workforce of the high-tech sector. This scenario is especially noticeable in multinational corporations located in Israel, where the percentage of employees recruited to the reserves is significantly higher than the national average,\" Simon said.Simon did not cite figures but the government has estimated as much as 15% of tech workers were called to military service.He said their absence harms both current projects and \"sends a worrying message to their global headquarters about the reliability and stability of their Israeli operations, and of Israel in general\".Simon also pointed to the preceding 10 months of political turmoil amid a judicial overhaul plan that harmed foreign investments and led to a few R&D closures.He cautioned that \"multinational companies may freeze or reduce their investments after the conflict, and even to close their R&D activities here\" which would carry harmful results for Israel\\'s economy and the \"future of innovation, weaken our global position and undermine our internal stability even more\".

       "  'Title': 'More questions than answers as Israeli PM Netanyahu seeks security control over Gaza',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s declaration this week that Israel would take control of security in Gaza for an indefinite period has added to uncertainty over the future of the besieged enclave, more than a month into the war.Israeli officials have since tried to make clear that they do not intend to reoccupy Gaza, from which Israeli forces withdrew in 2005. But there has been no clarity on how to ensure security without maintaining a military presence in the territory.Only one thing has been stressed repeatedly – Hamas must be destroyed.The movement launched an attack on southern Israel on Oct 7, which Israel says killed 1,400 people. Hamas also took more than 240 hostages.Israel responded to that attack with retaliatory strikes on Gaza, which is ruled by Hamas. Israel’s bombardments have killed more than 10,500 Palestinians.“They cannot be here,” former defence minister Benny Gantz, who joined Mr Netanyahu in an emergency unity government in October, said on Wednesday. “We can come up with any mechanism we think is appropriate, but Hamas will not be part of it.”Mr Gantz, who said Hamas presented an existential threat to Israel, told reporters that Israel would have to ensure “security superiority” around Gaza, but the specifics remain vague in the absence of any coherent idea of the political future.Mr Ron Dermer, one of Mr Netanyahu’s closest aides, who like Mr Gantz is in the inner war Cabinet, said Israel would have to play an active role in the oversight of Gaza.But he said that much would depend on how the enclave was governed in future.“Will there be a force that will prevent terrorism from emerging there? Will there be a Palestinian force that will build and govern Gaza the way it should for the people of Gaza, and not just to destroy Israel? That remains to be seen,” he told US network NBC on Tuesday.The war is already among the bloodiest episodes in decades of conflict.Whole swathes of the densely populated coastal strip have been flattened.More than 1.5 million people, some two-thirds of the population, have been forced from their homes, according to United Nations figures.Rebuilding the physical infrastructure and reconstructing the governance of the area will present a colossal challenge which will force Israel to work with the Palestinians, diplomats say, despite the bitter enmity on both sides.As the war continues, there have been calls from Western countries, including the United States, for a renewal of stalled efforts to agree on a two-state solution, with an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a news conference in Tokyo: “Now, the reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict, but it is imperative that Palestinian people (be) central to governance in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.“It is also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza.”Challenges aheadIsrael originally withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, drawing the wrath of hardline settlers who were forced to leave with the army when former prime minister Ariel Sharon decided the costs of maintaining a presence were too high.The challenges that are likely to confront any reshaped Israeli security mechanism have already been clearly demonstrated during more than 18 months of increasingly violent clashes in the nearby occupied West Bank.Some diplomats have mooted the possibility of a reshaped Palestinian Authority (PA) playing a role in the administration of Gaza, if Israel succeeds in its aim of dismantling Hamas.The PA used to run both Gaza and the West Bank, but was forcibly ousted from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. It now governs only sections of the West Bank, which is dotted with ever-growing Jewish settlements. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh recently told foreign reporters that the PA would not return to Gaza “on the back of an Israeli tank”.Those comments threw serious doubt on speculation that Israel will seek to offload responsibility for the day-to-day running of the enclave onto its previous masters. In any case, the PA has long struggled to impose its authority even in the West Bank. In theory, it is responsible for order in the area, but it is mistrusted by both Israel and large sections of the Palestinian population. In its place, the Israeli army has largely taken the job of combating militant activity.Over the past 18 months, Israeli troops have killed hundreds of Palestinians – hardened militant fighters, stone-throwing young people and uninvolved civilians – and made thousands of arrests across the West Bank. In the same period, dozens of Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians.Cities such as Nablus and Jenin, which earlier in 2023 was the scene of a two-day battle involving hundreds of Israeli troops backed by drones and helicopter gunships, have become strongholds for militant groups including Hamas.Mr Dermer said that while Israeli troops had physically entered West Bank towns, they had essentially been absent from Gaza for the last 17 years.  “Obviously, we can’t repeat (this). So, after Hamas is removed from power... Israel is going to have to retain over-riding security responsibility indefinitely.”Jordan’s former deputy prime minister, Mr Marwan Muasher, told Reuters he had seen no convincing initiative on how Gaza might be governed once the conflict ended.“I don’t think that there is any clear thinking yet about what to do with the day after,” said Mr Muasher, who is vice-president for studies at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

       "  'Text': 'US President Joe Biden has warned Israel that occupying Gaza “would be a big mistake”. The warning seemed to be aimed directly at voices within the Israeli government who are calling for Israel to not only destroy Hamas, but also to occupy the Palestinian territory.Mr Biden\\xa0supports Israel’s right to defend itself\\xa0and to destroy Hamas’ military capabilities. But, if history is anything to go by, then occupation – as a strategy to destroy Hamas – seems doomed to fail. The Gaza Strip\\xa0was under Israeli military occupation following the June 1967 war (it was earlier occupied by Egypt) until Israel unilaterally withdrew from the territory\\xa0in 2005. This included the removal of 21 settlements comprising 8,500 Israeli civilians who were living amid 1.4 million Palestinians. The realities of occupationThe occupation of Gaza required the diversion of significant military and economic resources to protect the settlers in a land with which most Israelis did not feel a sense of kinship. Polls\\xa0from 2004\\xa0and\\xa02005\\xa0of Israeli public opinion showed that between 53 per cent and 60 per cent supported the disengagement plan.Indeed, the recent Hamas attacks are a painful reminder of the occupation’s costs. In response to rising tensions in recent weeks in the West Bank and East Jerusalem (both occupied by Israel since 1967 and previously under Jordanian occupation), the Israeli army diverted its entire Gaza division to protect Israeli settlers in the West Bank and to prevent a deadly escalation there over the Jewish holidays. This left the Israeli military significantly under-equipped and under-manned to respond immediately and decisively to the Hamas attacks from Gaza.Already burdened by policing missions around Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and with the ever-present threat of a military confrontation with Hezbollah (the Iranian-backed Shi’ite militia group established in the early 1980s) along its northern border, the notion of a military reoccupation of Gaza by Israel would probably see its resources stretched not only beyond capacity, but also beyond its long-term interests.The Israeli government’s stated aims for its current operation have so far been vague. “Destroying Hamas’ military capabilities” may mean different things to different people – from the precise targeting of its arms and the killing of its military leaders, to destroying Hamas as an idea.What occupation cannot solveMilitary occupation is unlikely to kill the violent Hamas ideology. Indeed, it was the first Palestinian popular uprising (intifada) against the Israeli occupation in the West Bank which gave rise to\\xa0Hamas in 1987, as a younger, Islamist alternative to the Fatah leadership. Fatah, the dominant faction of the Palestinian Authority (PA) which administers the Palestinian areas in the West Bank, is a secular, nationalist party that recognises Israel – whereas Hamas does not.So any sustained military occupation of Gaza is likely to garner more support for Hamas, rather than eradicate it. It is also unlikely that the PA in the West Bank would be eager to fill the power vacuum which would be created in the unlikely event that Israel successfully eradicates Hamas altogether, for fear of being depicted as Israeli collaborators by the Palestinian people. Moreover, an occupation brings with it the responsibility of administering the daily lives of 2.3 million Palestinians. This is something that neither Israel nor the PA wants or can do in the current circumstances.Lessons from 1982Israeli leaders should also take lessons from the last time the country tried to eradicate a terrorist group and impose regime change.In 1982, the Israeli military invaded southern Lebanon to remove the threat of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) to its northern towns. It ended with a failed alliance with the Christian Phalange party in Lebanon, which directly led to the\\xa0Sabra and Shatila massacre\\xa0and an 18-year Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, ending with a\\xa0“chaotic” withdrawal in 2000. None of Israel’s options to achieve its aim of destroying Hamas’ military capabilities is easy. Relying solely on air strikes will lead to a large number of civilian casualties, and is unlikely to destroy\\xa0Hamas’ tunnels\\xa0or kill its military leaders.A ground operation will not only lead to a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented proportions, but is also likely to start a creeping, short-term occupation leading to a permanent occupation – as the history of the June 1967 and 1982 Lebanon wars shows.Since its military and civilian withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, and following Hamas’ takeover of the territory from Fatah in 2007, Israel has blockaded the strip for security reasons by air, land and sea, effectively controlling who and what is allowed to enter and leave. Egypt has similarly blockaded the southern border of the Gaza Strip by Rafah.While Israel no longer occupies Gaza – inasmuch as it is not responsible for the daily lives of Gazans – the continuous blockade has significantly contributed to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the strip. That Hamas has proven to be a more capable terrorist organisation than an effective government has only set the Palestinian quest for freedom and statehood back even further.Asaf Siniver is professor of international security, University of Birmingham.

       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM – An Israeli invasion of Gaza will face an enemy that has built a formidable armoury with Iran’s help, dug a vast tunnel network to evade attackers and has shown in past ground wars it can exact a heavier toll on Israeli troops each time.Israel has massed tanks on Gaza’s border and ministers have suggested the start of an invasion is a matter of when, not if.Israel’s generals will look to lessons learned from past ground offensives in 2008 and 2014 that also aimed to smash the Palestinian militant group Hamas, an Israeli security source and experts said.Yet Hamas has till now emerged a tougher opponent each time. On Oct 7, it staged its most devastating display when its fighters killed more than 1,300 Israelis.It was the deadliest attack on Israeli soil since its founding in 1948.Israeli air strikes in response have killed more than 1,400 people in Gaza so far.Neither side can know exactly what to expect in a ground war. Israel has promised a campaign exceeding anything ever launched to wipe Hamas “off the face of the earth”.Hamas has shown its ability to survive and surprise, and will be fighting in a dense urban setting with powerful weapons.“A ground incursion will be like diving into the unknown by the occupation and its forces,” an official in one of Gaza’s Palestinian militant factions told Reuters, giving only his nickname of Abu Abdallah.Israeli officials have made clear it will not be a swift or easy campaign. And this time, it faces the problem of scores of Israeli hostages seized by Hamas on Oct 7.The hostages could now be held in the warren of tunnels that Israeli troops call the “Gaza Metro”, and which soldiers must clear to destroy Hamas.“The purpose is to defeat the entire military capabilities and military apparatus of Hamas, and that will demand a long operation,” an Israeli security source told Reuters.“Most of the targets, people, equipment, logistics are located underground and it’s possible the hostages are located underground,” the source said. “The purpose will be to flatten the ground to then be able to get to the underground bunkers.”In Gaza, a strip of land with 2.3 million people, the risk of a mounting civilian death toll could also complicate Israel’s military plans.Levelling the landBased on experience, Israel’s bunker buster bombs and high-tech Merkava tanks will be up against booby-trapped tunnels, fighters using the underground network to strike and vanish, and a range of Hamas weaponry that includes Russian-made Kornet anti-tank missiles that Israel first reported used in 2010.Hundreds of thousands of reservists are being mobilised by Israel for combat against fighters who, one former official in Israel’s Shin Bet security service said, could number 20,000.Hamas spokespeople have declined to comment to Reuters about any military operations or planning.Mr Saleh Al-Arouri, deputy chief of the Hamas politburo, told Al Jazeera that before Hamas unleashed its assault on Israel, it had a defence plan that was stronger than its attack plan.Israeli officials have not discussed any military details. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said they were “preparing for a ground offensive”, and the goal was to heavily damage “terrorist infrastructure” so it was no longer a threat to Israel.But Gaza residents have already spotted what they believe to be invasion preparations in the intense Israeli bombardment of the enclave since the initial assault by Hamas. Residents say bombing has levelled corridors of land along the border that could open the way for ground forces.But Palestinian militant official Abu Abdallah said Gaza’s fighters were ready.“Planes do not determine a battle. Many fighters would prefer to face tanks and forces on the ground, armed by the developed capabilities built up over years,” he said.Since 2007, when Hamas took control of Gaza from the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, Israel has launched two major land incursions. Each time it suffered a higher death toll of soldiers – nine killed in 2008 and 66 in 2014.This time, Hamas has had longer to prepare, making no secret of support coming from Iran, Israel’s arch regional foe.Learning lessonsMore recently than its Gaza incursions, Israeli troops were confronted with the growing capability of militants in a West Bank clash in June. In a raid on Jenin refugee camp, a militant hotbed, Israeli soldiers were ambushed and pinned down. Apache helicopter support was called in to help.“The difference between what is happening in Gaza compared to the battle of Jenin camp is between heaven and earth,” said a member of the Jenin Brigade. “We do not have military barracks or heavy weapons such as rockets and Kornets.”A former senior Israeli commander, who asked not to be identified, said confrontations like Jenin still offered lessons as the military prepared for a Gaza incursion.“You will have to look at Gaza (as having) much more high capacities and with highly developed technology all over,” he said.Israel’s government, which under Prime Minister Netanyahu had been one of the most hard-right in its history but now includes opposition figures to build national unity, has said the public must prepare for a long conflict to reach its goal.“We started the offensive from the air, later on we will also come from the ground,” Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told soldiers near the border fence on Tuesday, one of the strongest signals that an invasion will go ahead.Mr Shalom Ben Hanan, a former top official in Israel’s Shin Bet security service and now a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism at Israel’s Reichman University, said a ground offensive was the only way to dismantle Hamas.“There is no sterile war. We will suffer casualties,” he said. “We are going to fight, to make combat with very experienced and trained fighters.”“It must be a decisive win.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'What links Hamas to the Axis of Resistance and its patron Iran? ',\n",
       "  'Text': 'In the decades-long regional hostility between Israel and Iran, Palestinian militant group Hamas has never come fully under the Islamic republic’s sway.It has in recent years taken money from Qatar, learnt propaganda lessons from ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria), and kept up relations with Egyptian intelligence.But last Saturday’s multi-pronged assault on Israel, cheered on by Iran, has prompted a reassessment of how deep the ties have grown between Hamas and Teheran. For Israel and regional powers, the main question is whether Teheran-backed groups that pose an existential threat to Israel – the so-called Axis of Resistance – provide an explanation for how Hamas developed the capacity to mount such an audacious attack.“The Axis of Resistance... aims to annihilate and wipe out Israel from existence,” said Mr Abdul Majeed Awad, head of Hamas’ political and media relations office in Lebanon. Other allies had not been informed of the operation until after it was under way, but Iran and its most important proxy, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, had been “following every moment” of the assault, Mr Awad said.Iran has in recent years worked hard to strengthen ties with Palestinian militant groups, according to Israeli officials, portraying itself as the champion of their cause at a time when several Arab states have been moving to normalise relations with the Jewish state.Israel’s assessment is that Teheran has made a push to move money, arms – and even drugs – into the occupied West Bank via Jordan as part of its efforts to foment attacks by Palestinian militants against Israeli targets.“Iran views the Palestinian arena as a major opportunity to promote its vision of surrounding Israel with a ‘ring of fire’... heavily armed terror armies that can activate firepower and cross-border raids against Israel, under Iranian influence,” said Israel-based defence analyst Yaakov Lappin. “This is part of Iran’s goal of challenging Israel from within and on its borders.”Predominantly Shi’ite, Iran already has a proxy in Gaza in Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a smaller group that sometimes rivals Hamas, and sometimes fights alongside it. But bringing the larger and more established Hamas, which controls Gaza, more fully into its orbit would be a coup.Hamas is “not in Iran’s pocket. It has a multitude of relations, with Qatar and Turkey among others,” said Dr Mohanad Hage Ali, a Beirut-based senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East think-tank. “This new alliance with Iran, however important it is, only stands if it’s reciprocated and if it will back up Hamas.”Israel has estimated that the PIJ, which also claimed to have taken part in Saturday’s assault, and Hamas receive US$100 million (S$137 million) a year between them from Iran. Teheran has also provided training for fighters, and expertise in how to improve its production of rockets to make them more lethal and accurate.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, said of the attack on Israel: “God willing, the cancer of the usurper Zionist regime will be eradicated at the hands of the Palestinian people and the resistance forces throughout the region.”Yet Hamas – a Sunni Islamist movement formed in the 1980s around the time of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising – has always maintained a strategic ambiguity to maintain the maximum support for its cause. “All who oppose the Zionist regime are our friends – the Palestinian cause is universal,” Mr Ahmed Yousef, a senior adviser to Hamas leaders, told the Financial Times last year.Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war across the Middle East – in the likes of Syria, Lebanon and Iraq – with rocket and drone strikes as well as assassinations. Iran harasses Israel from the north via Hezbollah in Lebanon, and from the north-east, where Iranian and Hezbollah fighters have free rein along the Syrian border. In 2021, Israel and Iran were involved in tit-for-tat naval sorties that involved both civilian and quasi-military vessels in the Mediterranean.The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Iranian security officials “helped plan” Saturday’s surprise attack, a report that was denied by Iran and its proxies. “We emphatically stand in unflinching support of Palestine; however, we are not involved in Palestine’s response, as it is taken solely by Palestine itself,” Iran’s United Nations mission said.A senior Israeli military official said that while his view was that the “Iranians are involved”, he cautioned not to overstate Teheran’s role.Mr Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official, said Iran’s goal in building up groups such as Hamas and PIJ in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and various Shi’ite militias in Syria was to “destroy the State of Israel... We have to ask ourselves if the war Hamas has started is the beginning of a multi-front assault.”Despite the Hamas offensive being long in the planning – Israeli analysts contend it probably took months, if not a year, to develop – the timing may have been linked to Iranian and Hamas fears over the growing prospects of an Israel-Saudi Arabia normalisation deal.Mr Khamenei also recently warned that it was a “mistake” to bet on “normalisation with the Zionist regime”, while Iran’s Foreign Ministry has described the Hamas invasion as “spontaneous”.One incident that points to increased cooperation between Israel’s foes was a visit to Lebanon in April by Mr Ismail Haniyeh, a top Hamas leader, to meet Palestinian factions inside Lebanon. He asked them to “unite and escalate”.Other members of Hamas’ leadership visit Iran and regularly meet Hezbollah, while some Hamas leaders have moved to Lebanon.The increased presence of Hamas’ leadership in Lebanon meant Hezbollah and Lebanon were “tied to inter-Palestinian tensions and to violence against Israel’s occupation”, Dr Hage Ali said, adding that this dalliance could lead to broader regional conflict.In a sign of the widening struggle, Israel shelled southern Lebanon on Monday, prompted by a cross-border raid by the PIJ. The Israeli military said soldiers, backed by helicopters, killed at least two gunmen who had crossed the border.Dr Hage Ali continued: “If Hamas is in existential danger with an Israeli revenge attack and ground invasion, what good is this alliance if the conflict wouldn’t widen to include attacks on other fronts?” FINANCIAL TIMES',\n",

       "  'Text': 'PARIS – Countries around the world have reacted to a wave of attacks by land, sea and air carried out by Palestinian armed group Hamas that Israel says has claimed hundreds of lives. The statements by world leaders ranged from outright condemnation of the attacks and strong support for Israel from Western nations, to support for Hamas from some Middle Eastern countries. Many have called for a de-escalation of the conflict, after Israel launched air strikes and other military operations targeting Gaza that the Palestinian authorities say have killed hundreds.Here is a round-up of the reactions:United States President Joe Biden said US support for Israel was “rock solid and unwavering”. On Sunday, he ordered US ships and warplanes to move closer to Israel.Washington also promised to provide munitions and equipment to Israel, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on Sunday.Several US citizens were among those killed in Hamas’ surprise attack, according to a US National Security Council spokesperson.Iran President Ebrahim Raisi said on Sunday that Iran supported the Palestinians’ right to self-defence, and warned that Israel must be held accountable for endangering the region.A senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had already backed the attack last Saturday, calling it a “proud operation”.Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry called for “an immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, protection of civilians and self-control”.United Nations The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday, a day after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged diplomatic efforts in the Middle East to prevent wider conflict.Diplomats said the Security Council did not consider any joint statement, let alone a binding resolution, with members led by Russia hoping for a broader focus than condemning Hamas.European Union European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had already condemned the attack by Hamas last Saturday.On Sunday, she posted on X, formerly Twitter: “The full scale of the brutality of the Hamas terror attack leaves us breathless. “Defenceless people, brutally murdered in cold blood on the streets. We stand strong with Israel and its people. Today, the EU and Israeli flags fly side by side.”China “China is deeply concerned about the current escalation of tension and violence between Palestine and Israel,” a Foreign Ministry statement said on Sunday. Beijing “calls on all parties concerned to remain calm and exercise restraint, cease fire immediately, protect civilians and prevent further deterioration of the situation”, it added.Russia Russia’s Foreign Ministry called for an “immediate ceasefire” and negotiations towards “a comprehensive, lasting and long-awaited peace”, said spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is fending off a Russian invasion, said on Sunday that he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to offer condolences “for the numerous casualties caused by the terrorist attack”.He said last Saturday that Israel had an indisputable right to defend itself, adding that “terror is always a crime”.South Africa The ruling African National Congress issued a statement on Sunday saying: “It can no longer be disputed that apartheid South Africa’s history is occupied Palestine’s reality.“As a result, the decision by Palestinians to respond to the brutality of the settler Israeli apartheid regime is unsurprising.”The statement added it was clear that “the degenerating security situation is directly linked to the unlawful Israeli occupation”.France French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna held talks by telephone with several of her counterparts in the Middle East in a bid to “prevent the conflict degenerating” by spreading to other parts of the region, a ministry statement said on Sunday.France’s Foreign Ministry also called for the immediate release of the hostages taken by Hamas.Germany German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sunday that Israel has the right to defend itself against “barbaric attacks” and “to protect its citizens and to pursue the attackers”.He called Mr Netanyahu to tell him Germany stands “firmly and unwaveringly by Israel’s side”. German-Israeli nationals are among the hostages taken by Hamas, a Foreign Ministry source confirmed.Britain British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Sunday he had assured Mr Netanyahu of London’s “steadfast support”.“We will do everything that we can to help. Terrorism will not prevail,” he added in a statement.Turkey Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday urged Israel and Hamas “to support peace” and refrain from harming civilians.“There is no good in (attacking) civilians,” he said. “We are ready to do everything to reduce the tension.”Italy Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called Mr Netanyahu to reaffirm “Rome’s full solidarity” following the Hamas offensive. “Italy stands by the Israeli people at this difficult time,” said a government statement.Japan Japan “strongly condemns” the attacks, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa said on Sunday, as well as the taking of hostages by Hamas.“Meanwhile, we are seriously concerned about the large number of casualties in the Gaza Strip as a result of attacks by the Israel Defence Forces,” her statement continued, calling for restraint.Vatican City Pope Francis on Sunday said that “terrorism and war do not lead to any resolutions, but only to the death and suffering of so many innocent people.“War is a defeat! Every war is a defeat! Let us pray that there be peace in Israel and in Palestine”.India Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India stands “in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour”. “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel,” he said.Venezuela Venezuela’s government expressed its “deep concern” over the clashes.In a statement on X, it said the fighting was “the result of the impossibility of the Palestinian people to find in multilateral international legality a space to assert their historic rights”.Yemen In Yemen, Huthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa expressed their support for “the heroic jihadist operation”. In a statement on the website of the Huthi-controlled Saba news agency, the Iran-aligned militant group said the attack “revealed the weakness, fragility and impotence” of Israel. AFP',\n",

       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM - Israeli forces and Hamas militants appeared to be battling at close range in Gaza City as thousands of civilians fled south on Wednesday to avoid being trapped in the heart of the conflict.The Israeli military said its troops had advanced into the heart of Gaza City, Hamas’ main bastion and the biggest city in the seaside enclave, while the Islamist group said its fighters had inflicted heavy losses. Hamas’ armed wing on Wednesday released a video that appeared to show intense street battles alongside bombed out buildings in Gaza City.Israeli tanks have met heavy resistance from Hamas fighters using underground tunnels to stage ambushes, according to sources with Iran-backed Hamas and the separate Islamic Jihad militant group.Israel struck Gaza in response to a cross-border Hamas raid on southern Israel on Oct 7 in which gunmen killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Palestinian officials said 10,569 people have been killed as at Wednesday, 40 per cent of them children. Israel says 33 of its soldiers have been killed.One clip from the Hamas video released on Wednesday showed fighters running past piles of debris and stopping to fire shoulder-propelled missiles at Israeli tanks. Another showed them shooting rifles from perches behind buildings and dumpsters. Reuters was not able to authenticate the footage.Exiled Hamas commander Saleh al-Arouri told Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV that Israeli forces may gain control of some areas in Gaza.“But that will not stop the resistance’s fight against soldiers and tanks. The more (Israel) spreads and expands on the ground, the deeper its losses will become”, he said.Israel bombs tunnelsChief Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said on Wednesday that combat engineers were using explosive devices to destroy Hamas’ tunnel network that stretches for hundreds of kilometres beneath Gaza. The military said it had destroyed 130 tunnel shafts so far. Israel has blamed Hamas for civilian deaths in Gaza, saying it is using Gazans as human shields and hiding arms and operations centres in residential areas.As the war entered its second month, Israeli troops took foreign reporters to the edges of Gaza City on Wednesday. Journalists saw a devastated landscape where every building within sight was scarred by battle.Walls were blown away while bullet holes and shrapnel dotted the facades and palm trees were shredded and broken.Lieutenant Colonel Ido, deputy commander of the 401st Brigade, who did not give his last name, said that by the time soldiers reached these buildings, all the families had left.“So we know that everyone here is our enemy. We have not seen any civilians here. Only Hamas,” he said, standing in a badly damaged children’s bedroom that was painted pink.Soldiers on the press tour said that beneath the family apartment were two floors of workshops used to make weapons, including drones discovered in five wooden boxes. It was not possible to verify the claim.50,000 Palestinians head southSome 50,000 Palestinian civilians left the north on Wednesday, Rear-Adm Hagari said, during a four-hour window of opportunity announced by Israel. He said they left “because they understand that Hamas has lost control in the north”.Thousands still remain inside the encircled north, including at Gaza City’s main Al Shifa hospital, where Ms Um Haitham Hejela was sheltering with her young children in an improvised tent.“The situation is getting worse day after day,” she said. “There is no food, no water. When my son goes to pick up water, he queues for three or four hours in the line.”The Israeli military has repeatedly told residents to evacuate the north or risk being trapped in the violence. Huge numbers of displaced people from among Gaza’s 2.3 million population are already crammed into schools, hospitals and other sites in the south.But the central and southern parts of the small, besieged Palestinian enclave also came under fire again.Palestinian health officials said an air strike that hit houses in the Nusseirat refugee camp killed 18 people on Wednesday morning. In Khan Younis, six people, including a young girl, were killed in an air strike.“We were sitting in peace when all of a sudden an F16 air strike landed on a house and blew it up, the entire block, three houses next to each other,” said witness Mohammed Abu Daqa.“Civilians, all of them civilians. An old woman, an old man and there are others still missing under the rubble.”International alarm is mounting over the humanitarian toll of Israel’s onslaught. The level of death and suffering is “hard to fathom”, UN health agency spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said in Geneva.UN officials and G-7 world powers stepped up appeals for a humanitarian pause in the war to help alleviate the suffering of civilians in Gaza, where necessities including food, medicine and fuel are running out.Negotiations mediated by Qatar, where several Hamas political leaders are based, are trying to secure the release of 10 to 15 hostages in exchange for a one- to two-day humanitarian pause in Gaza, a source briefed on the talks said on Wednesday.Possible third strike on JabaliaAt least 19 people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house near a hospital in north Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp on Wednesday, the enclave’s Interior Ministry said.There was no immediate Israeli comment or details from the scene of the reported attack, which if confirmed would be the third on Gaza’s largest refugee camp in a week.The Palestinian authorities said at least 195 civilians were killed in those Israeli strikes, which flattened multi-storey dwellings. Israel said its air attacks on Jabalia last week killed two Hamas commanders and a number of militants while targeting operational tunnels dug beneath civilian districts. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The Hamas tunnel city beneath Gaza – a hidden front line for Israel',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM/LONDON - What lies in wait for Israeli ground troops in Gaza, security sources say, is a Hamas tunnel network hundreds of kilometres long and up to 80m deep, described by one freed hostage as “a spider’s web” and by one expert as the “Viet Cong times 10”.The Palestinian militant group has different kinds of tunnels running beneath the sandy 360 sq km coastal strip and its borders.These include attack, smuggling, storage and operational burrows, Western and Middle East sources familiar with the matter said.The United States believes Israel’s special forces will face an unprecedented challenge having to battle Hamas militants while trying to avoid killing hostages held below ground, a US official said.US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin noted that Iraq’s nine-month-long battle to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State might prove to have been easier than what awaits the Israelis – likely to be “a lot of IEDs (improvised explosive devices), a lot of booby traps, and just a really grinding activity”.Israel has invested heavily in\\xa0tunnel detection – including a sensor-equipped underground barrier it called an “iron wall”.But Hamas is still thought to have working tunnels to the outside world.After the last round of hostilities in 2021, Hamas’s leader in Gaza Yahya Al-Sinwar said: “They started saying they destroyed 100km of Hamas tunnels. I am telling you, the tunnels we have in the Gaza Strip exceed 500km. Even if their narrative is true, they only destroyed 20 per cent of the tunnels.”Hostage witnessThere has been no corroboration of the comment by Mr Sinwar, who is thought to be hiding underground ahead of an expected Israeli ground offensive.But the estimate of hundreds of kilometres is widely accepted by security analysts, even though the blockaded coastal strip is only 40km long.With Israel in full control of Gaza’s air and sea access and 59km of its 72km land borders – with Egypt controlling 13km to the south – tunnels provide one of the few ways for Hamas to bring in weapons, equipment and people.While it and other Palestinian groups are secretive about their networks, recently released Israeli hostage, 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz, said: “It looked like a spider’s web, many, many tunnels,” adding: “We walked kilometres under the ground.”Hamas believes that with Israel’s overwhelming aerial and armoured military superiority, tunnels are a way to cut some of those advantages by forcing Israel’s soldiers to move underground in cramped spaces the Hamas fighters know well.An Israeli military spokesperson said on Thursday: “I won’t elaborate on the number of kilometres of tunnels but it is a high number, built under schools and residential areas.”Urging the United Nations Security Council to intervene, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called for an immediate cessation of “aggression” on Gaza, and asked for moves towards “a political solution instead of military and security solutions”.Underground city Israeli security sources say Israel’s heavy aerial bombardments have caused little damage to the tunnel infrastructure, with Hamas naval commandos able to launch a seaborne attack targeting coastal communities near Gaza this week.“Although we have been attacking massively for days and days, the (Hamas) leadership is pretty much intact, as is the ability to command and control, the ability even to try and launch counter-attacks,” said Mr Amir Avivi, a former brigadier general whose senior positions in the Israeli military included deputy commander of the Gaza division, tasked with tackling tunnels.“There is a whole city all over Gaza underneath with depths of 40m to 50m. There are bunkers and headquarters and storage, and of course they are connected to more than a thousand rocket launching positions.”Other sources estimated depths of up to 80m.One Western security source said: “They run for miles. They are made of concrete, and very well made. Think of the Viet Cong times 10. They have had years and lots of money with which to work with.”Another security source from one of Israel’s neighbouring countries said Hamas’s tunnels from Egypt remain active.“The supply chain is still intact these days. The network involved in facilitating coordination (includes) some Egyptian military officers. It is unclear if there is knowledge of this by the Egyptian army,” he said.A small number of narrower deep smuggling tunnels were still operating until recently between Egypt and Gaza, according to two security sources and a trader in the Egyptian city of El Arish, but operations had slowed to a near halt since the Israel-Hamas war started. Egyptian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday\\xa0Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said, while inspecting military units in Suez, that the army’s role was to secure Egyptian borders. \\xa0Long gameHamas was created in Gaza in 1987 and is thought to have begun digging tunnels in the mid-1990s, when Israel granted Mr Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organisation some degree of self-rule in Gaza.The tunnel network is a key reason why Hamas is stronger in Gaza than in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Israel’s settlements, military bases and monitoring devices make it harder to get anything in from Jordan.Tunnelling became easier in 2005 when Israel pulled its soldiers and settlers out of Gaza, and when Hamas won power in a 2006 election.Shortly afterwards, Hamas’s military wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and killed two others after burrowing 600m to raid the Kerem Shalom base on the Gaza border.A year later, Hamas launched a military strike against Mr Arafat’s forces in Gaza using tunnel-mounted attacks.Although the military tunnels remained off-limits to outside eyes, during that era Gaza smugglers would show off their scarcely concealed commercial tunnels under the Rafah border.These were around 1m wide and used winch motors to haul goods along the sandy tunnel floors in hollowed-out petrol barrels.One Rafah tunnel operator, Mr Abu Qusay, said a 800m tunnel took three to six months to dig and could yield profits of up to US$100,000 (S$137,100) a day. The most profitable item was bullets, bought for US$1 each in Egypt and fetched more than US$6 in Gaza. Kalashnikov rifles, he said, cost US$800 in Egypt and sold for twice that.In 2007, the military wing is thought to have brought its commander Mohammed Deif into Gaza through a tunnel from Egypt. Deif was the mastermind behind Hamas’s Oct 7 attack into Israel, which killed 1,400 people.Tunnel huntingProfessor Joel Roskin, a geomorphologist and geologist with Israel’s Bar-Ilan University, said it was difficult to map the tunnel network accurately from the surface or space.He added that highly classified information was essential for 3D mapping and imagery visualisation.Among the elite units tasked with going underground is Yahalom, specialist commandos from Israel’s Combat Engineering Corps known as “weasels” who specialise in finding, clearing and destroying the tunnels.Earlier this week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Yahalom fighters, telling them: “I rely on you, the people of Israel rely on you.”Israeli sources said what awaits them is formidable, and they faced an enemy that has regrouped and learned from previous Israeli operations in 2014 and 2021.“There are going to be a lot of booby traps. They have thermobaric weapons that they didn’t have in 2021, which are more lethal. And I believe they acquired a lot of anti-tank weapon systems that are going to try to hit our APCs (armoured personnel carriers), tanks,” said Mr Amnon Sofrin, a former brigadier general and former commander of the Combat Intelligence Corps.Mr Sofrin, who was also previously head of the intelligence directorate with Israel’s Mossad spy agency, said Hamas would also be trying to kidnap soldiers.Professor Daphne Richemond-Barak at Israel’s Reichman University and author of the book Underground Warfare said the conflicts in Syria and Iraq had changed the situation.“What the IDF (Israeli military) is likely to face inside the tunnels is also all of the experience and all of the knowledge that has been gained by groups like ISIS (Islamic State) and has been... passed on to Hamas.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'KIBBUTZ MISHMAR HA’EMEK, Israel – The 10 gunmen from Gaza knew exactly how to find the Israeli intelligence hub – and how to get inside.After crossing into Israel, they headed east on five motorcycles, two gunmen on each vehicle, shooting at passing civilian cars as they pressed forward.Over 15km later, they veered off the road into a stretch of woodland, dismounting outside an unmanned gate to a military base. They blew open the barrier with a small explosive charge, entered the base and paused to take a group selfie. Then they shot dead an unarmed Israeli soldier dressed in a T-shirt.For a moment, the attackers appeared uncertain about where to go next. Then one of them pulled something from his pocket: a colour-coded map of the complex.Reoriented, they found an unlocked door to a fortified building. Once inside, they entered a room filled with computers – the military intelligence hub. Under a bed in the room, they found two soldiers taking shelter.The gunmen shot both dead.This sequence was captured on a camera mounted on the head of a gunman who was later killed. The New York Times reviewed the footage, then verified the events by interviewing Israeli officials and checking Israeli military video of the attack.They provide chilling details of how Hamas, the militia that controls the Gaza Strip, managed to surprise and outmanoeuvre the most powerful military in the Middle East last Saturday – storming across the border, overrunning more than 70 sq km, taking more than 150 hostages and killing more than 1,300 people in the deadliest day for Israel in its 75-year history.With meticulous planning and extraordinary awareness of Israel’s secrets and weaknesses, Hamas and its allies overwhelmed the length of Israel’s front with Gaza shortly after dawn, shocking a nation that has long taken the superiority of its military as an article of faith.Using drones, Hamas destroyed key surveillance and communications towers along the border with Gaza, imposing vast blind spots on the Israeli military. With explosives and tractors, Hamas blew open gaps in the border barricades, allowing 200 attackers to pour through in the first wave and another 1,800 later that day, officials say. On motorcycles and in pickup trucks, the assailants surged into Israel, overwhelming at least eight military bases and waging terrorist attacks against civilians in more than 15 villages and cities.Hamas planning documents, videos of the assault and interviews with security officials show that the group had a surprisingly sophisticated understanding of how the Israeli military operated, where it stationed specific units, and even the time it would take for reinforcements to arrive.The Israeli military says that, once the war is over, it will investigate how Hamas managed to breach its defences so easily.But whether the armed forces were careless with their secrets or infiltrated by spies, the revelations have already unnerved officials and analysts who have questioned how the Israeli military – renowned for its intelligence gathering – could have inadvertently revealed so much information about its own operations.The outcome was a staggering series of atrocities and massacres, in what Israeli President Isaac Herzog has described as the worst mass killing of Jews in a single day since the Holocaust.It shattered Israel’s aura of invincibility and provoked an Israeli counter-attack on Gaza that has killed more than 1,900 Palestinians in a week, the ferocity of which has never been seen in Gaza.It also upended assumptions that Hamas, long designated a terrorist group by Israel and many Western nations, had gradually become more interested in running Gaza than in using it to launch major assaults on Israel.Hamas made Israelis think it was “busy with governing Gaza”, Mr Ali Barakeh, a Hamas leader, said in a television interview on Monday. “All the while, under the table, Hamas was preparing for this big attack.”‘Hamas in the kibbutz!’The terrorists were inside Mrs Addi Cherry’s home, on the other side of an unlocked door.Mrs Cherry, her husband and their three children were hiding inside their eldest son’s bedroom, listening to the gunmen wander around their living room.“Please help us,” Mrs Cherry texted a friend as one of the assailants walked closer and closer to the bedroom door.Then he gripped the door handle.The Cherry family’s day had begun with a burst of rockets from Gaza, not long after 6am.Mrs Cherry, an economist, and her husband Oren, an engineer, rushed with their children into their eldest son’s bedroom, which doubled as a bomb shelter.Initially, the events of the morning felt distressingly familiar. The Cherry family lives in kibbutz Nahal Oz, a rural village of some 500 residents in Israel, a few hundred yards east of the border with Gaza. Early morning rocket fire – and the ensuing rush to the safe room – is a frequent feature of life in the region.“Like always,” Mrs Cherry remembered thinking.But this morning soon felt different. The rockets kept coming, many of them headed deep into Israeli territory.Then, from the fields around the village, came the sound of gunshots.Mr Cherry left the bedroom and peeked through the shutters on their living room windows.“‘Oh, God’,” Mrs Cherry remembered her husband shouting. “‘Hamas in the kibbutz! Hamas in the kibbutz!’”It was 7.20am.Hundreds of Hamas invaders, carrying guns and shoulder-borne rocket launchers and wearing the group’s green headband, were streaming through the village fields.It was part of a coordinated assault that, documents and video show, assigned squads of assailants to precise targets. As some swept through military bases, others charged into residential areas, ruthlessly kidnapping and killing civilians.They would reach the Cherrys’ street within minutes.The family had to act quickly. Their bomb shelter – a teenager’s bedroom – had no lock.The parents grabbed a chair and wedged it under the door handle – making it harder to open.They dragged a small cabinet across the floor and pressed it against the chair.Then they waited. There was an army base next to the village. Its troops would be here within minutes, Mrs Cherry remembered thinking.What she did not know was that many of them were already dead.‘Take soldiers and civilians’All along the border, the Hamas gunmen had already overrun most, if not all, of the Israeli border bases.Footage from the attackers’ head-mounted cameras, including the video of the raid on the intelligence hub, showed Hamas gunmen – from its highly trained Nukhba brigade – smashing through the barricades of several bases in the first light of the morning.After breaching, they were merciless, gunning down some soldiers in their beds and underwear. In several bases, they knew exactly where the communications servers were and destroyed them, according to a senior Israeli army officer.With much of their communications and surveillance systems down, the Israelis often could not see the commandos coming. They found it harder to call for help and mount a response. In many cases, they were unable to protect themselves, let alone the surrounding civilian villages.A Hamas planning document – found by Israeli emergency responders in one village – showed that the attackers were organised into well-defined units with clear goals and battle plans.One platoon had designated navigators, saboteurs and drivers – and mortar units in the rear to provide cover for the attackers, the document shows.The group had a specific target – a kibbutz – and the attackers were tasked with storming the village from specific angles. They had estimates for how many Israeli troops were stationed in nearby posts, how many vehicles they had at their disposal and how long it would take those Israeli relief forces to reach them.The document is dated October 2022, suggesting that the attack had been planned for at least a year.Elsewhere, other assailants were posted to key road junctions to ambush Israeli reinforcements, according to four senior officers and officials.Some units had specific instructions to capture Israelis for use as bargaining chips in future prisoner exchanges with Israel.“Take soldiers and civilians as prisoners and hostages to negotiate with,” the document said.‘We are going to die’The terrorists smashed their way into the Cherrys’ house shortly before 10am, according to texts that Mrs Cherry sent to friends at the time.They had already killed the kibbutz guards and a civilian security volunteer who had rushed to confront them in the opening moments of the assault, according to the village leadership.Now the terrorists were going house by house, trying to find people to kill and kidnap.“Please send help,” Mrs Cherry typed into her phone.At the Cherrys’ house, they forced their way in through the door. They charged in, shouting and ransacking the house, Mrs Cherry said.“We are going to die,” she remembered thinking.The family waited in terrified silence, hoping the intruders would ignore the door to the bedroom and assume everyone was away.Mrs Cherry and her husband put all their weight against the cabinet, to brace the chair underneath the door handle.Guy, 15, their eldest son, stood next to the door, holding an 18-pound dumbbell. If someone did break in, the plan was to drop it on the assailant’s head.Then the handle twitched.The parents began to push the cabinet.The handle continued to rattle.Then it stopped. The assailant walked away.A few streets away, the family of Mr Miki Levi, who oversees the kibbutz gardens, had an even closer call.After a terrorist squad chased Mr Levi, 47, inside his safe room, the attackers sprayed bullets at the reinforced door, Mr Levi said in an interview.Some of the bullets pierced the door, creating large openings, and Mr Levi said he also fired back with his pistol, shredding it further. His wife and two young daughters sheltered to the side.Changing tactics, the terrorists later brought two of his neighbours – a mother and her 12-year-old daughter, Mr Levi said.At gunpoint, the mother and child were told to persuade him to open up, Mr Levi said.“‘Come out and stop shooting’,” Mr Levi recounted one of them saying. “‘The terrorists won’t do anything to you’.”Eventually, the terrorists gave up that approach and returned with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, Mr Levi said.It was only when Mr Levi shot one attacker in the thigh that they finally left, he added.The mother and child, Mr Levi suspects, are now captives in Gaza.‘Bodies were burning’Brigadier-General Dan Goldfus said he drove south without knowing where exactly he should go.The 46-year-old paratrooper commander had been on leave at home, jogging in his neighbourhood north of Tel Aviv, Israel. Then he saw a video from the south, showing terrorists cruising through a city, entirely unimpeded.Without waiting for orders, the general said he ran home, changed into his uniform and headed south.He picked up guns and two soldiers from his base in central Israel and called friends and colleagues to find out what was happening.Only a few picked up. Of the rest, “there was nobody really understanding the full picture”, Brig-Gen Goldfus said in an interview.The speed, precision and scale of Hamas’ attack had thrown the Israeli military into disarray, and for many hours afterwards, civilians were left to fend for themselves.Using the few scraps of information he could glean, Brig-Gen Goldfus said he and the soldiers headed to a village north of Nahal Oz, then gradually worked their way south.It was around 10am. All around him was carnage and atrocity.Dead Israelis lined the roads, alongside the husks of burnt-out, overturned cars.At the site of an all-night outdoor rave, gunmen had killed an estimated 260 partygoers.“Bodies were burning,” Brig-Gen Goldfus remembered seeing at the site.The attack by Hamas had unleashed a violent free-for-all. Some residents of Gaza had poured over the undefended border after it was breached, at times streaming what they were doing on their phones. Gazans were looting and ransacking homes, taking computers, clothes, crockery, televisions and phones, survivors said.In some Israeli villages, residents had been burned alive in their homes while terrorists stalked civilians at every turn, looking for people to capture and kill. Grandparents, toddlers and a nine-month-old baby were seized and taken back to Gaza, some of them squeezed between their kidnappers on motorcycles.During much of the mayhem, the Israeli army was almost nowhere to be seen.Near the kibbutz of Reim, Brig-Gen Goldfus said he ran into another senior commander by chance. Like him, the officer had rushed to the scene on instinct, without any instructions, and had assembled a small group of soldiers.There and then, the two men came up with their own ad hoc strategy.“There’s no orders here,” Brig-Gen Goldfus said. “I said, ‘You take from this place and further south – and I’ll take from this place and further north’.”That was how some of the Israeli counter-attack took place: soldiers or civilian volunteers – including retired generals in their 60s – rushing to the region and doing what they could.Mr Israel Ziv, a former general, reached a nearby battle in his Audi.Mr Yair Golan, a retired deputy chief of staff and former leftist lawmaker, said he took a gun and began rescuing survivors of a massacre at a rave who were hiding in nearby bushes.“We are brought up to run as fast as possible towards the fire,” said Brig-Gen Goldfus. “So that we can be the first one there.”‘It’s OK. We’re Jewish.’The intelligence hub near Gaza was one of the first places to be recaptured by Israel.In the late morning, soldiers and reservists from different units reached the base from separate directions, overpowering the 10 Gazan gunmen who had filmed their deadly assault on video.The camera mounted on the Hamas commander’s head captured the moment he was shot and killed. The camera falls off, bouncing along the ground. By the time the video stops, the commander can be seen slumped on the ground, revealing his long beard and thinning hairline.In other parts of southern Israel, the first formal reinforcements came from an Israeli commando unit that arrived in helicopters, according to a senior Israeli officer.They were followed by other special operations units, including Israeli navy seals and a reconnaissance unit trained to operate deep inside enemy lines rather than on Israeli soil.Sometimes, the commandos joined forces with volunteers without body armour who had rushed into the fray to rescue family members.Mr Noam Tibon, a former general, drove south with his pistol to try to retake Nahal Oz, where his son Amir, a journalist, was trapped.In the early afternoon, the elder Mr Tibon joined a squad that was making its way through the kibbutz, house by house.By Sunday afternoon, several villages and bases still had some kind of Hamas presence. The whole area would not be fully secured for days.Mrs Cherry emerged at around 5pm on Saturday in Nahal Oz to find her home turned upside down, the microwave torn from the wall, drawers ripped from their cabinets and a pool of drying blood on the floor.She had heard a gun battle in and around her home earlier in the day. She believed a terrorist had died in the house – and that his bloodied corpse had been carried off by fellow fighters.Some survivors refused to open up, even after the army arrived.When soldiers reached the home of Ms Oshrit Sabag, another resident of Nahal Oz, she feared they were terrorists in disguise.Even after the soldiers began chatting to one another in Hebrew to prove who they were, Ms Sabag, 48, was unconvinced.It was only their Jewish prayers that made her relax.“‘It’s OK, it’s OK,’” Ms Sabag remembered them saying. “‘We’re Jewish.’” NYTIMES',\n",

       "  'Text': 'DUBAI – The heads of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Israel’s Mossad met Qatar’s prime minister in Doha on Nov 28 to build on the two-day extension of a truce between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, a source briefed on the visit said. The meeting was “to build on the progress of the extended humanitarian pause agreement and to initiate further discussions about the next phase of a potential deal”, the source told Reuters.The outcome of the talks, which were also attended by Egyptian officials, was unclear, the source added.Mr David Barnea, the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service, CIA director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani met one day after Qatar announced the two-day extension of an original four-day truce deal in Gaza that had been due to expire overnight.Qatar, where several political leaders of Hamas are based, has been leading negotiations between the Palestinian militant group and Israel.The truce has brought the first respite to the Gaza Strip in seven weeks, during which Israel bombed the territory heavily in response to a violent rampage on Oct 7 by Hamas gunmen who killed around 1,200 people and took 240 captives.Israel has sworn to annihilate Hamas, which rules Gaza. The health authorities in Gaza say Israel’s bombardment of the tiny, densely populated territory has so far killed more than 15,000 people, around 40 per cent of them children.Mr Barnea and Mr Burns were previously in Qatar to meet Sheikh Mohammed on Nov 9.During the first four days of the truce, Hamas fighters released 50 Israeli women and children who had been taken hostage. In return, Israel released 150 security detainees from its jails, all women and teenagers.As part of the two-day truce extension Hamas has agreed to release an additional 10 Israeli women and children each day.So far, there is no indication that Hamas is willing to release any Israeli men or military personnel among those taken captive.

       "  'Text': 'GAZA  -     As an unrelenting Israeli bombardment intensified on Saturday, bakeries in Gaza were running out of bread, drinking water was in short supply and power outages left families without charged phones to find out if fleeing relatives were safe.\"There is an electricity crisis, food crisis, water crisis, a crisis of everything,\" Eyad Abu Mutlaq, 45, said in Khan Younis in south Gaza, a region filling up with thousands of people fleeing the north for fear of an Israeli invasion.\"It is only God who can resolve it,\" he said after touring four bakeries to find long queues or no supplies.The flood of people arriving in south Gaza after Israel told them on Friday to leave an area in the north has stretched resources that were already strained to breaking point.The United Nations has urged Israel to \"avert a humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza, a slither of land with 2.3 million people wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.In its response to the devastating Oct. 7 assault from Gaza by Palestinian militant group Hamas, Israel has imposed a \"total blockade\" halting food supplies and cutting electricity to Gaza. A week after that began, shops are running out of many items.\"I was looking for basic food, eggs, rice, canned food, even milk for the children and I couldn’t find them,\" said Khan Younis resident, giving only her nickname of Um Salem. \"This is how Israel is fighting us, through starvation of our children. They either kill children by bombs or soon by starvation.\"Israel said it had told people to leave the north for their safety and to ensure they were not caught up in the conflict. It said it would guarantee the safety of Palestinians fleeing the area on two main roads until 4 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Friday.Those who have fled say many roads and streets are often difficult to use, and some impassable, because of damage.APPEAL TO END THE \\'SIEGE\\'Gaza authorities said 70 people were killed and 200 were wounded when Israel struck cars and trucks carrying people fleeing the north. Reuters could not independently verify this.The Hamas assault last week killed more than 1,300 Israelis. The fighters also took scores of hostages in the worst breach of Israel\\'s defences since its creation in 1948.The death toll from Israel\\'s response was more than 2,200 people by Saturday.Without the option of crossing the border into Egypt, more of Gaza\\'s population has been cramming into the south seeking shelter, as Israel builds up troops and tanks on border. Israel has already launched raids.\"We need to truck fuel into Gaza now. Fuel is the only way for people to have safe drinking water. If not, people will start dying of severe dehydration, among them young children, the elderly and women,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the U.N. refugee agency UNRWA,.\"Water is now the last remaining lifeline. I appeal for the siege on humanitarian assistance to be lifted now,\" he said.U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday he was making it a priority to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, working with Israel, Egypt, Jordan, other Arab states and the U.N. He said he was also ensuring Israel had what it needed to respond to the Oct. 7 attack, including bringing any U.S. hostages home.The Gaza authorities have reported 10,000 people injured so far in the bombardment. Hospitals are struggling to cope. Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra said hospitals were running low of medical supplies and fuel to keep going.More than 1,695 buildings and high-rise towers have been destroyed in the Israeli airstrikes, in addition to 7,000 housing units, the Hamas government media office said.With power cuts and no fuel to operate generators, Adel Shaheen has been charging people\\'s phones with his solar panels during daylight hours.\"We don\\'t see the electricity anymore and if we want to charge a mobile we have to wait for the sun, otherwise we have no electricity at all,” he said. \"People want to charge (mobile phones) so they can make calls to check on their families.\"But he said most Gazans were now \"cut off from the world\".

       "  'Title': 'Israel makes first raids into Gaza; Netanyahu says it is ‘only the beginning’',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM – Israeli infantry made their first raids into the Gaza Strip on Friday since Hamas fighters rampaged through southern Israel, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a campaign of retaliation had only just begun. Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas after its fighters burst out of Gaza a week ago and stormed through towns and villages, killing 1,300 Israelis, mainly civilians, and making off with scores of hostages.Since then, Israel has placed the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, under a total siege and bombarded it with unprecedented air strikes. The Gaza authorities say 1,900 people have died.On Friday, Israel gave more than a million residents of the northern half of Gaza 24 hours to flee to the south to avoid an onslaught. Hamas vowed to fight to the last drop of blood and told residents not to go.Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said troops backed by tanks had mounted raids to attack Palestinian rocket crews and seek information on the location of hostages, the first official account of ground troops in Gaza since the crisis began.“We are striking our enemies with unprecedented might,” Mr Netanyahu said, in a brief statement which, unusually, was televised after the Jewish Sabbath had begun.“I emphasise that this is only the beginning.”Several thousand Gaza residents took to roads heading out of the northern part of the Gaza Strip, but it was impossible to assess their numbers. Many others said they would not leave.“Death is better than leaving,” said Mohammad, 20, standing in the street outside a building reduced to rubble in an earlier Israeli air strike near the centre of Gaza.Mosques broadcast the message: “Hold on to your homes. Hold on to your land.”“We tell the people of northern Gaza and from Gaza City, stay put in your homes, and your places,” Mr Eyad Al-Bozom, spokesman for the Hamas Interior Ministry, told a news conference.The Gaza authorities said 70 people were killed and 200 were wounded when Israel struck cars and lorries carrying people fleeing the north of the strip for the south. Reuters could not independently verify the reported incident.The United Nations and other organisations warned of a disaster if so many people were forced to flee, and said the siege of the enclave should be lifted to let in aid.The situation in Gaza has reached a “a dangerous new low”, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday.“We need immediate humanitarian access throughout Gaza, so that we can get fuel, food and water to everyone in need. Even wars have rules.”Earlier, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said it would be impossible for Gazans to obey Israel’s order to leave the north without “devastating humanitarian consequences”, prompting a rebuke from Israel that the UN should condemn Hamas and support Israel’s right to self-defence.“The noose around the civilian population in Gaza is tightening. How are 1.1 million people supposed to move across a densely populated war zone in less than 24 hours?“ UN aid chief Martin Griffiths wrote on social media.‘Distance yourselves from Hamas’White House national security spokesman John Kirby said such a huge evacuation was a “tall order”, but that Washington would not second guess Israel’s decision to tell civilians to get out.“We understand what they’re trying to do and why they’re trying to do this – to try to isolate the civilian population from Hamas, which is their real target,” he said on MSNBC.Mr Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority that is a rival of Hamas, told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Jordan that the forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza would constitute a repeat of 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from what is now Israel. Most Gazans are the descendants of such refugees.Gaza is already one of the most crowded places on earth, and for now there is no way out. Israel has imposed a total blockade, and Egypt, which also has a border with the enclave, has so far resisted calls to open it to fleeing residents.‘I promise you, we will win’Hamas issued a video on Friday purporting to show its fighters cuddling a baby and a toddler in one of the villages it ransacked. Israel has said entire families were slaughtered.“We are fighting for our home. We are fighting for our future,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said, meeting US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who came to Israel a day after a visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. “The path will be long, but ultimately I promise you, we will win.”Mr Austin said military aid was flowing into Israel but that this was the time for resolve and not revenge.On Friday, Mr Blinken travelled to Jordan where he met King Abdullah as well as Mr Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank but lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007. Mr Blinken later travelled to Qatar, a United States ally with influence among Islamist groups.In the West Bank, demonstrators supporting Gaza fought gun battles with Israeli security forces. Palestinian officials said 11 people were shot dead.There have also been fears of hostilities spreading to new fronts, including Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, where clashes this week have already been the deadliest since 2006.Reuters news videographer Issam Abdallah was killed on Friday while working in southern Lebanon. Reuters said it was seeking more information and working with the authorities in the region.Earlier, Reuters reported that Israeli shelling had struck a Lebanese army observation post at the border. The Israeli military said it fired in response to a suspected armed infiltration, which it later said had been a false alarm. Lebanese state media reported that shells struck near Alma Al-Shaab and Dhayra, sites of repeated clashes in the past week.Israel’s UN envoy said it would investigate what had happened in the area following the journalist’s death.“We always try to mitigate and avoid civilian casualties. Obviously, we would never want to hit or kill or shoot any journalist that is doing its job,” Mr Gilad Erdan said. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Israel vows to demolish Hamas as troops prepare to move on shattered Gaza',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM - Israel\\'s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday to \"demolish Hamas\" as his troops prepared to move into the Gaza Strip in pursuit of Hamas militants whose deadly rampage through Israeli border towns shocked the world.Israel has urged exhausted Gazans to evacuate the south, which hundreds of thousands have already done in the besieged enclave that is home to more than 2 million people. Hamas, which runs Gaza, has told people to ignore Israel\\'s message. Inside Gaza\\'s narrow and crowded streets, conditions were deteriorating as deaths from Israeli air strikes rose. Bodies were stored in ice cream freezer trucks because moving them to hospitals was too risky and cemeteries were full.With fears of the conflict spilling further, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken continued his tour of Middle East states, seeking to prevent escalation and secure the release of 155 hostages Israel says were taken by Hamas back into Gaza.Arab leaders stressed the need to protect Gaza civilians.\"The reaction went beyond the right to self-defence, turning into collective punishment,\" said Egypt\\'s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Israel\\'s retaliatory strikes.Clashes on Israel\\'s border with Lebanon, the deadliest since 2006, have underscored the dangers of regional spillover. On Sunday, Hamas\\' armed wing Al Qassam Brigades said it fired 20 rockets from Lebanon at two Israeli settlements while Lebanon\\'s Hezbollah militia said it fired missiles at Israeli barracks in Hanita and had inflicted casualties.Israel said it was striking Lebanon in retaliation, and the UN peacekeeping force said its headquarters in south Lebanon had been hit by a rocket.Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, warned Israel of escalation if it kept attacking Palestinians. \"If the Zionist aggressions do not stop, the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger,\" said Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, adding that Teheran could not simply stay an observer.Mr Blinken met Saudi Arabia\\'s Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh then Sisi in Cairo. Amid international efforts to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Mr Blinken said the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt would reopen. \"There\\'s a determination in every country I went to, to make sure that this conflict doesn\\'t spread,\" said Mr Blinken, who was due back in Israel on Monday.\"They are using their own influence, their own relationships, to try to make sure that this doesn\\'t happen.\" ISRAELI RESOLVEMr Netanyahu convened Israel\\'s expanded emergency Cabinet, including former opposition lawmakers, in a show of unity. \"Hamas thought we would be demolished. It is we who will demolish Hamas,\" he said.Israel is carrying out the most intense bombardment Gaza has ever seen in response to the killing of 1,300 people when Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct 7. They shot men, women, children and soldiers and seized hostages in the worst attack on civilians in Israel\\'s history.Graphic video of the attacks, and reports from medical and emergency services in the overrun towns and kibbutzes, deepened Israelis\\' sense of shock. France said 19 of its citizens had died in the Hamas attacks, with 13 others still unaccounted for and possibly taken hostage. Canada raised its fatality toll to five.Authorities in Gaza said at least 2,670 people had so far been killed by Israel\\'s retaliatory strikes, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded. Another 1,000 people were missing and believed to be under rubble.Gaza hospitals are running short of supplies and struggling to cope with the numbers of wounded.Among them was four-year-old Fulla Al-Laham, 14 members of whose family, including her parents and siblings, died in an Israeli air strike. \"May God keep me alive to take care of her,\" said her grandmother Um Muhammed Al-Laham, who held the girl\\'s hand as she lay in a hospital on a drip with a bandaged arm.ON THE MOVEIsrael\\'s military, which has massed tanks on Gaza\\'s border in preparation for a ground offensive, says it is targeting Hamas and its infrastructure. Israeli aircraft on Sunday struck about 250 military targets, killing the Hamas southern district commander, the military said.Israeli military chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi told soldiers near the Gaza border they would be entering Gaza to root out Hamas, targeting \"every place, every commander, every operator.\"\"You are about to do something big and important, that needs to change the situation for a long time in a clear way,\" Mr Halevi said.An Israeli blockade has prevented fuel, food and water from entering Gaza, although Netanyahu had agreed with US President Joe Biden to resume the water supply to parts of southern Gaza, a minister said on Sunday. The Israeli military said some 600,000 Gazans had left the northern half of the territory, which includes Gaza City\\'s more than 1 million residents.Some Palestinians who went south said they were heading back north because they were attacked wherever they went.Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, an intensive care doctor on a children\\'s ward at the Kamal Edwan hospital in northern Gaza, said the order to evacuate was impossible.\"In this ward as you can see, there are children who are attached to ventilators, and now we have been asked to evacuate the hospital, where should we evacuate these children?\"The World Health Organization said Israel\\'s orders to evacuate 22 Gaza hospitals were a \"death sentence for the sick and injured\". UN relief operations in Gaza \"are on the verge of collapse,\" said Mr Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the UN agency for the Palestinians, UNRWA.\"The number of people seeking shelter in our schools and other UNRWA facilities in the south is absolutely overwhelming, and we do not have any more the capacity to deal with them,\" he said.

       "  'Title': 'What war crimes laws apply to the Israel-Palestinian conflict?',\n",
       "  'Text': 'THE HAGUE - Conflict between Israel and Palestinian forces since militant group Hamas\\' weekend assault have created a huge and rising death toll on both sides.The war falls under a complex international system of justice that has emerged since World War Two.What laws govern the conflict?Internationally accepted rules of armed conflict emerged out of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which have been ratified by all UN member states and supplemented by rulings at international war crimes tribunals.A series of treaties governs the treatment of civilians, soldiers and prisoners of war in a system collectively known as the \"Law of Armed Conflict\" or \"International Humanitarian Law\". It applies to government forces and organised armed groups, including Hamas militants.If alleged Palestinian perpetrators of atrocities in Israel and all alleged perpetrators of crimes on the occupied Palestinian territories are not brought to justice at home, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is the only international legal organ able to bring charges. Domestic courts can apply so-called universal jurisdiction in war crimes cases, but that would be limited in scope.The ICC\\'s founding Rome Statute gives it legal authority to investigate alleged crimes on the territory of its members or by their nationals, when domestic authorities are \"unwilling or unable\" to do so.On Tuesday, the office of the prosecutor of the ICC confirmed that its mandate applies to potential crimes committed in the current conflict and said it continues to gather information.What is the role of the ICC?The International Criminal Court (ICC), the world\\'s permanent war crimes tribunals, opened in The Hague in 2002. It has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in its 123 member states or committed by its nationals.Many of the world\\'s major powers are not members, including China, the United States, Russia, India and Egypt. The ICC recognises Palestine as a member state, while Israel rejects the court\\'s jurisdiction and does not formally engage with it. With a limited budget and staff, ICC prosecutors are already investigating 17 cases ranging from Ukraine and Afghanistan to Sudan and Myanmar. The ICC budget has allocated less than 100,000 euros ($106,000) for investigations in the Palestinian territories for 2023 and is seeking additional resources.The ICC has had an ongoing investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the occupied Palestinian territories since 2021. It has not issued any arrest warrants.Prosecutors said in 2021 there was a reasonable basis to believe that violations had been committed on all sides, including by Israeli troops, Hamas militants and other armed Palestinian groups.What acts could violate war crimes law?New York-based Human Rights Watch cited as possible war crimes the deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate rocket attacks, and the taking of civilians as hostages by Palestinian armed groups, as well as the Israeli counter-strikes in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians.\"Deliberate killings of civilians, hostage-taking, and collective punishment are heinous crimes that have no justification,\" said Omar Shakir, the group\\'s Israel and Palestine director.The taking of hostages, murder and torture are explicitly banned under the Geneva Conventions, while Israel\\'s response could also be subject to a war crimes investigation. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant drew criticism from U.N. officials and human rights groups by announcing a tightened blockade to prevent food and fuel from reaching the Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million people.Do the Geneva Conventions apply?Israel has a right and duty to respond, US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday, adding that he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had discussed “how democracies like Israel and the United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law.”A siege can be considered a war crime if it targets civilians, rather than a legitimate means to undermine Hamas\\' military capabilities, or if found to be disproportionate.Attacks on military objectives have to be proportional under international law which means they must not lead to excessive loss of civilian life or damage to civilian objects in relation to the direct and concrete military advantage expected.Mr Nick Kaufman, a British-born Israeli defence lawyer at the ICC, cited the gruesome killings by Hamas militants of hundreds of revellers at a dance rave and civilians in several Kibbutz communities near the Gaza border as an obvious focus for a war crimes case.

       "  'Title': 'Explainer-What is Hezbollah? The Lebanese group backing Hamas in its war with Israel',\n",
       "  'Text': 'BEIRUT  -     Lebanon\\'s Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israel across the border for days in the deadliest escalation since they fought a major war in 2006, threatening to expand a conflict between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas.Backed by Iran, Hezbollah has said it is ready to help when the time comes in the war between Israel and Hamas, which is also backed by Tehran. Sources said last week Hezbollah\\'s attacks so far had been designed to be contained and so avoid another major war.Israel\\'s defence minister said on Oct. 15 that Israel had no interest in waging war on its northern front, and that if Hezbollah restrained itself then Israel would also keep the situation along the border as it is.    WHAT ARE THE ORIGINS OF HEZBOLLAH?Iran\\'s Revolutionary Guards founded Hezbollah in 1982, the middle of Lebanon\\'s 1975-90 civil war. It was part of Iran\\'s effort to exports its 1979 Islamic Revolution around the region and fight Israeli forces after their 1982 invasion of Lebanon.Sharing Tehran\\'s Shi\\'ite Islamist ideology, Hezbollah recruited Lebanese Shi\\'ite Muslims. The group has risen from a shadowy faction to a heavily armed force with major sway over the Lebanese state. The United States, some Western governments and others deem it a terrorist organisation.HOW POWERFUL IS HEZBOLLAH\\'S MILITARY?While other groups disarmed after Lebanon\\'s civil war, Hezbollah kept its weapons to fight Israeli forces that were occupying the predominantly Shi\\'ite south of the country. Years of guerrilla warfare led Israel to withdraw in 2000.Hezbollah demonstrated its military advances in 2006 during a five-week war with Israel, which erupted after it crossed into Israel, kidnapping two soldiers and killing others. Hezbollah fired thousands of rockets into Israel during the conflict, in which 1,200 people were killed in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 158 Israelis were killed, most of them soldiers.Hezbollah\\'s military power grew after it deployed into Syria, another of Iran\\'s allies in the region, to help President Bashar al-Assad fight mostly Sunni Muslim rebels.Hezbollah boasts weapons including precision rockets and drones, and says it can hit all parts of Israel. In 2021, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the group had 100,000 fighters.  Iran gives Hezbollah weapons and money. The United States estimates Iran has allocated it hundreds of millions of dollars annually in recent years.WHAT\\'S ITS ROLE IN THE ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT SO FAR?Hezbollah has deep ties to Hamas, which controls Gaza, and Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian faction backed by Iran.Hezbollah said it was in \"direct contact with the leadership of the Palestinian resistance\" on Oct. 7, the day Hamas militants carried out an unprecedented assault from Gaza into Israel, killing 1,300 people. In Israel\\'s intensive air strikes on Gaza in response, more than 2,750 people have been killed.Since Oct. 7, Hezbollah has exchanged cross-border fire with Israel numerous times. Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which both have a presence in Lebanon, have mounted attacks on Israel from Lebanon for the first time, including an Oct. 10 cross-border infiltration into Israel by Islamic Jihad.Tzachi Hanegbi, the national security adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Oct. 14 that the hostilities appeared to be restrained. Hanegbi warned Hezbollah not to take action that could lead to Lebanon\\'s \"destruction\".WHAT REGIONAL SWAY DOES HEZBOLLAH HAVE?Hezbollah has been a source of inspiration and support for other Iranian-backed groups across the Middle East. It has trained armed groups in Iraq and taken part in fighting there.Saudi Arabia says Hezbollah has also fought in support of the Iran-allied Houthis in Yemen. Hezbollah denies this. WHAT IS HEZBOLLAH\\'S ROLE IN LEBANON?Hezbollah\\'s influence is underpinned by its sophisticated arsenal and the support of many Lebanese Shi\\'ites who say the group defends Lebanon from Israel.Lebanese parties opposed to Hezbollah say the group has undermined the state and accuse it of unilaterally dragging Lebanon into armed conflicts. Hezbollah has ministers in government and lawmakers in parliament.It entered Lebanese politics more prominently in 2005 after Syria withdrew forces from Lebanon following the killing of former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri, who symbolised Saudi influence in the country.A U.N.-backed court convicted three Hezbollah members in absentia over the assassination. Hezbollah denies any role, describing the court as a tool of its enemies.In 2008, a power struggle between Hezbollah and its Lebanese political adversaries, who had the backing of the West and Saudi Arabia, spiralled into a brief conflict. Hezbollah fighters took over parts of Beirut after the government vowed to take action against the group\\'s military communications network.In 2016, Hezbollah-allied Christian politician Michel Aoun became president - in Lebanon\\'s sectarian political system the presidency is held by a Maronite Christian.Two years later, Hezbollah and its allies won a parliamentary majority. This majority was lost in 2022, but the group continued to exercise major political sway.The group campaigned against a judge investigating the 2020 Beirut port explosion, which devastated swathes of the capital, after he sought to question Hezbollah\\'s allies. The standoff prompted deadly clashes in Beirut in 2021.HAS HEZBOLLAH BEEN ACCUSED OF ATTACKS ON WESTERN TARGETS?Lebanese security officials and Western intelligence have said groups that were linked to Hezbollah carried out suicide attacks on Western embassies and targets and kidnapped Westerners in the 1980s. One group, Islamic Jihad, which is not related to the Palestinian organisation, was thought to be led by Imad Moughniyah, a top Hezbollah commander who was killed in a car bomb in Syria in 2008.The United States holds Hezbollah responsible for a suicide bombing that destroyed U.S. Marine headquarters in Beirut in 1983, killing 241 servicemen, and a suicide attack the same year on the U.S. embassy. A suicide bombing also hit a French barracks in Beirut in 1983, killing 58 French paratroopers.    Referring to those attacks and hostage-taking, Hezbollah leader Nasrallah said in a 2022 interview that they were carried out by small groups not linked to Hezbollah.WHAT DO WESTERN GOVERNMENTS OR OTHERS SAY ABOUT THE GROUP?Western countries including the United States designate Hezbollah a terrorist organisation. So do U.S.-allied Gulf Arab states including Saudi Arabia.The European Union classifies Hezbollah\\'s military wing as a terrorist group, but not its political wing.Argentina blames Hezbollah and Iran for the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires in which 85 people were killed, and for a 1992 attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires that killed 29 people. Iran and Hezbollah both deny responsibility. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Palestinian Americans fundraise for Gaza, as aid groups receive record donations',\n",
       "  'Text': 'NEW YORK – Palestinian Americans and aid groups in the United States are raising funds for Gaza, which faces a deepening humanitarian crisis as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth week – but they have as yet limited ability to get supplies into the besieged enclave.Aid organisations that serve civilians in Gaza say they are receiving record amounts of donations in a sign of public support for relief efforts, even as a growing stock of supplies remains stalled at Egypt’s Rafah border crossing.In the Gaza Strip, where 2.3 million people live, civilians are in dire need of clean water, food and medicine, emergency medics say. Half of Gaza’s population was already living in poverty before the crisis.“We’ve seen a significant increase in donations, unlike (anything) we’ve ever seen before,” said Mr Steve Sosebee, president of the US-based Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which has a staff headcount of 40 in Gaza, who provide medical support.He said the fund, which usually has an annual budget of around US$12 million (S$16.45 million), had raised US$15 million in just 10 days.However, with a web of political and logistical obstacles on getting aid in, much of the money and supplies intended for Gaza is in limbo, forcing aid groups to wait as they amass truckloads of goods.Hamas militants burst over the Gaza border and rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people and taking 229 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.In response, Israel launched its most intense air bombardment campaign on the tiny enclave, along with a “total siege”, banning food, water and fuel imports.Aid groups say they are building up supplies in hopes of eventually getting them through to civilians in Gaza, nearly half of whom are children.There has been “a five-fold increase in the total number of donors versus typical past emergencies”, said Mr Derek Madsen, chief development\\xa0officer of Anera, a non-partisan emergency relief group for refugees throughout the Middle East.The organisation, which maintains the privacy of individual donors, said it had recently received the largest single donation from an individual in its 55-year history.The majority of support comes from donors based in the US, he added, with individual donations averaging around US$138. The efforts mirror those of Jewish groups in the US and Canada, who also fundraised millions for Israel.Anera was using the last of its stocks this week to distribute meals and vegetable parcels in Gaza. Its staff of 12, like everyone in Gaza, were facing “unbelievable, unimaginable trauma”, he said.Glued to the televisionIn Ann Arbor, Michigan, Ms Rabia Shafie, national director of the Palestine Aid Society, said her group was speaking to student and Muslim groups on local university campuses and community centres to spread awareness and raise donations for the Red Crescent and UNRWA, the United Nations aid agency that serves Palestinian refugees.“The money is needed to help people survive at this point of time. Medical support is so essential,” she said.“People are glued to the television... watching the news moment to moment, and very stressed out over the situation,” said Ms Rabia, adding that it was difficult as a Palestinian American to watch “the massacre and injustice done to our people back home”.Hamas-governed Gaza is one of the most densely packed places on Earth, and its medical authorities say over 8,000 Palestinians have been killed since air strikes began, including more than 3,000 children.Mr Madsen called for a ceasefire and establishment of a humanitarian corridor “so that people literally do not starve to death, literally do not die of dehydration”.Last week, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, home to one of New York’s largest Muslim and Arab communities, hundreds of protesters called for a ceasefire with signs written in Arabic, Spanish, Hebrew and Korean.In Clifton, New Jersey, the Palestinian American Community Centre’s priorities are calling for US officials to support a ceasefire, and the hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza, said Ms Basma Bsharat, the education director of the centre.The centre has also been collecting cash donations to send on to UNRWA. It has asked people not to donate supplies, which it has no easy way of sending to those in need in Gaza.Last week, a woman came to the centre anyway, hauling bags filled with goods.  “We didn’t know how to say no,” said Ms Basma. “She was like, I just want to do something. I just want to help somehow.”“It’s a very difficult time, and the fact that we do see the support coming in it, it gives some relief,” she said. “It gives some kind of solace.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': \"Hamas' cash-to-crypto global finance maze in Israel's sights\",\n",
       "  'Text': 'LONDON/DUBAI  -     Palestinian militant group Hamas uses a global financing network to funnel support from charities and friendly nations, passing cash through Gaza tunnels or using cryptocurrencies to bypass international sanctions, according to experts and officials.However, Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, will face even more obstacles accessing funds after the rampage by the group\\'s gunmen that killed hundreds of Israelis, mainly civilians. Israel has responded with the heaviest bombardment of Gaza in 75 years of conflict.Earlier this week, Israeli police said they froze a Barclays bank account the authorities said was linked to Hamas fundraising and blocked cryptocurrency accounts used to gather donations, without specifying how many accounts or the value of the assets.The move provided a glimpse of a complex financial web, some legitimate, much hidden, that underpins Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, and its government in the Gaza Strip, which it has run since 2007.Matthew Levitt, a former U.S. official specialised in counterterrorism, estimated the bulk of Hamas\\' budget of more than $300 million came from taxes on business, as well as from countries including Iran and Qatar or charities.Last February, the State Department said that Hamas raises funds in other Gulf countries and gets donations from Palestinians, other expatriates and its own charities.Reuters was unable to reach Hamas officials for comment for this story. In the past, Hamas has said financial restrictions placed on its donors were an attempt to neutralise legitimate resistance against Israel.Hamas, sanctioned as a terrorist organization by the United States and countries such as Britain, had increasingly used cryptocurrencies, credit cards or contrived trade deals to avoid mounting international restrictions, Levitt said.\"Hamas has been one of the more successful users of crypto for the financing\\xa0of terrorism,\" said Tom Robinson, co-founder of blockchain research firm Elliptic.However, this year Hamas said it would back away from crypto, after a spate of losses. Cryptocurrency\\'s ledger system can make such transactions traceable.Blockchain researchers TRM Labs said this week in a research note that crypto fundraising has previously increased following rounds of violence involving Hamas. After fighting in May 2021, Hamas-controlled crypto addresses received more than $400,000, TRM Labs said.However, since last weekend\\'s violence, prominent Hamas-linked support groups had moved just a few thousands dollars through crypto, TRM noted.\"One likely reason for the low donation volume is that Israeli authorities are targeting them immediately,\" TRM said, adding that Israel had seized cryptocurrency worth \"tens of millions of dollars\" from Hamas-linked addresses in recent years.Between Dec. 2021 and April this year, Israel seized almost 190 crypto accounts it said were linked to Hamas.SHIPS AND SHELLSWhether through crypto or other means, Hamas\\' allies have found ways to get money to Gaza. The U.S. State Department has said that Iran provides up to $100 million annually in support to Palestinian groups including Hamas, and has cited methods of moving the money through shell companies, shipping transactions and precious metals.  Iranian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.By last year, Hamas had established a secret network of companies managing $500 million of investments in companies from Turkey to Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Treasury has said, announcing sanctions on the firms in May, 2022.Israel has long accused Iran\\'s clerical rulers of stoking violence by supplying arms to Hamas. Tehran, which does not recognise Israel, says it gives moral and financial support to the group.Backing the Palestinian cause has been a pillar of the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution and a way for the country to fashion itself as a leader of the Muslim world.     Gas-rich Qatar too has paid hundreds of millions of dollars to Gaza since 2014, at one point spending $30 million per month to help operate the enclave\\'s sole power plant and to support needy families and public servants in the Hamas-run government. \"Qatari aid provides 100 dollars to the poorest Palestinian families and extends the period of electricity during a day in Gaza,\" a Qatari official said in response to a request for government comment, adding that it had helped \"maintain stability and quality of life for ... Palestinian families\".Qatar walks a foreign policy tightrope, hosting the region\\'s largest U.S. military base, the Taliban and other groups, often allowing it to mediate.CASH RULESQatar\\'s funding for Gaza actually passes through Israel, a source familiar with the process said. The funds are transferred electronically from Qatar to Israel. Israeli and U.N. officials hand-carry cash over the border to Gaza.The cash is distributed directly to needy families and public servants in Gaza and each family or individual must sign next to their name that they\\'ve received the cash. One copy of that sheet goes to Israel, one goes to the UN and one goes to Qatar.\"Qatari aid to the Gaza Strip is fully coordinated with Israel, the UN and the U.S.,\" the Qatari government official said.In recent years, Qatar bought fuel from Israel for Gaza\\'s sole power station. It also sent Egyptian fuel that Hamas can resell, using the proceeds for salaries. Stephen Reimer of the think tank, Royal United Services Institute, predicted fresh attempts to fully restrict the group\\'s access to formal financial channels would have limited success. \"Their financing tactics have grown to circumvent these.\" REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'WASHINGTON  -The White House on Thursday said it was exploring a series of pauses in the Israel-Hamas conflict to help people safely exit Gaza and allow humanitarian aid to get in, but reiterated its opposition to a full ceasefire.National security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that such pauses should be temporary and localized, and insisted they would not stop Israel from defending itself.\"What we\\'re trying to do is explore the idea of as many pauses as might be necessary to continue to get aid out and to continue to work to get people out safely, including hostages,\" he told reporters at a regular White House briefing. President Joe Biden spoke on Wednesday about the need for a pause to provide time for the release of hostages held by Hamas, but has ruled out calling for a full ceasefire.His fellow Democrat, Senator Dick Durbin, on Thursday told CNN it was time for a ceasefire, while Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, called for a humanitarian pause to allow critical aid to reach civilians.United Nations experts are also urging a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, saying time is running out for Palestinian people there who find themselves at \"grave risk of genocide.\"Israel says it is aiming its attacks at Hamas, not civilians, and accuses the group of using them as human shields.Nearly four weeks of Israeli bombardment against the Gaza Strip in retaliation for deadly attacks by Hamas gunmen in southern Israel on Oct. 7 have killed at least 9,061 people, made up of a majority of women and children, health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave say.The White House on Thursday said 79 of its citizens have left the Gaza Strip in the two days since a crossing opened to Egypt, and it hoped more could be released in coming days, but conceded the situation remained \"fluid.\"Kirby told reporters that 55 more aid trucks were expected to enter Gaza on Thursday, bringing the total to more than 220, but said increasing aid remained a top priority for Biden.He said the United States was speaking with Israel daily and urging it to avoid civilian casualties. He noted that U.S. military officers had traveled to Israel to share lessons learned in past urban conflicts but they had since returned home, and Washington was not helping Israel with its targeting.\"There are things you can do from the ground that you can\\'t do from the air, particularly if you have good intelligence,\" he said, without elaborating.\"We\\'re doing everything we can to work with our Israeli counterparts to try to minimize the risk of civilian deaths and collateral damage,\" Kirby said. \"We are giving them the tools, including perspective and advice but also weapons, to be able to conduct these operations in the most efficient way possible, and in a way that minimizes civilian harm.\"Kirby said the scope of Israel\\'s operations showed \"they are making efforts to try to minimize civilian casualties,\" adding it was clear that some casualties were still occurring.Asked if the United States bore responsibility for civilian deaths if it was providing such weapons, Kirby insisted that Washington was not \"making the targeting decisions.\" REUTERS',\n",

The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said civilians faced the “immediate possibility of starvation” due to the lack of food supplies. Palestinian news agency Wafa said a number of Palestinians were killed and others injured in an Israeli strike that hit a group of displaced people near the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt – the transit point for aid. Al Jazeera TV cited sources as saying that nine people were killed in the strike. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the reported strike, and Reuters could not verify it.In other developments, Israel said its troops had found a tunnel shaft used by Hamas at Al-Shifa Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip.The hospital, packed with patients and displaced people and struggling to keep operating, has been a major focus of global concern this week. Israel says Hamas has stored weapons and ammunition and is holding hostages in a network of tunnels under hospitals like Shifa, using patients and people taking shelter there as human shields. Hamas denies this.With the war about to enter its seventh week, there is no sign of any let-up despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.The conflict was triggered by a cross-border raid by Hamas militants on Oct 7 that killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, in the deadliest day in the state’s 75-year-history.More than 11,500 Palestinians, at least 4,700 of them children, have now been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military assault on Hamas-ruled Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry – a toll that far surpasses previous bouts of conflict in recent years.Israel has vowed to wipe out the militant group. Whole neighbourhoods of Gaza have been flattened in air and artillery strikes, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, and the humanitarian situation is catastrophic, aid agencies say.Trucks suspendedThe UN said there would be no cross-border aid operation on Nov 17 due to fuel shortages and a communication shutdown.  For a second consecutive day on Nov 16, no aid lorries arrived in Gaza due to lack of fuel for distributing relief.WFP executive director Cindy McCain said nearly the entire population was in desperate need of food assistance.“Supplies of food and water are practically non-existent in Gaza and only a fraction of what is needed is arriving through the borders,” she said in a statement.“With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,” Ms McCain said.A UN human rights official said Israel must allow water and fuel into Gaza to restart the water supply network.“Every hour that passes with Israel preventing the provision of safe drinking water in the Gaza Strip, in brazen breach of international law, puts Gazans at risk of dying of thirst and diseases,” Mr Pedro Arrojo-Agudo said.The World Health Organisation on Nov 17 said it was very worried about the spread of disease in Gaza, citing more than 70,000 reported cases of acute respiratory infections and over 44,000 cases of diarrhoea, far more than expected.The Israeli military’s chief of staff said Israel was close to destroying Hamas’ military system in the northern Gaza Strip, and there were signs the army was taking its campaign to other parts of the coastal enclave of 2.3 million people.Israel accused Hamas of preventing people from heading to the south of the Gaza Strip, which the militant group denied.The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of Al-Shifa, Gaza’s biggest hospital.The video, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a deep hole in the ground, littered with and surrounded by concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.The army said its troops also found a vehicle in the hospital containing a large number of weapons.Reuters journalists have been unable to reach anyone inside Al-Shifa Hospital for more than 24 hours.Hamas on Nov 16 said claims by the United States that the group uses Shifa for military purposes were “a repetition of a blatantly false narrative, demonstrated by the weak and ridiculous performances of the occupation army spokesman”. Israeli officials said Hamas held some of the 240 hostages taken by gunmen on Oct 7 in the hospital complex.On Nov 17 the Israeli military said soldiers retrieved the body of a female soldier who had been held captive in a building near Shifa.The military confirmed her death on Nov 14 after Hamas issued a video of her alive, followed by images of what it said was her body after she was killed in an Israeli strike.On Nov 16, troops recovered the body of another woman hostage, also in a building near Shifa.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Hamas’ Al-Quds Brigades said they had engaged Israeli forces for several hours in the city of Jenin overnight into Nov 17, unleashing a “torrent of fire” and laying ambushes with explosives.Israel’s military said warplanes struck militants in Jenin who had opened fire on Israeli soldiers. It said at least five of the militants were killed.At least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the Oct 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The violence there has underscored fears that the territory, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, could spiral out of control in tandem with the conflict in Gaza. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Singapore “deeply regrets” the impact of Israel’s military operations on Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Nov 17.“We strongly urge Israel to do its utmost to protect all civilians and medical facilities in Gaza. We urge all parties to comply fully with international humanitarian law,” it said in a statement.“Civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, should be protected.”\\xa0MFA also said that Hamas should not use these premises for military purposes or civilians as human shields, and reiterated its call for the immediate and safe release of civilian hostages in Gaza.On Nov 15, Israeli troops entered Al-Shifa, Gaza’s biggest hospital, following a days-long siege that has caused global alarm over the fate of civilians trapped inside. Reuters quoted a Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson as saying that there was no water, food or baby milk in the hospital, which was packed with 650 patients and about 7,000 people displaced by weeks of Israeli air strikes and artillery bombardments. MFA also said that Singapore remains deeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Palestinian civilians have borne the brunt of Israel’s weeks-long military campaign in retaliation for an Oct 7 attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel also says that Hamas took more than 240 hostages. Singapore welcomed the adoption of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2712, which calls for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors in Gaza. The resolution was adopted by the Security Council on Wednesday, with 12 members voting in favour, none against and three abstentions (Russia, Britain and the United States). “Every effort must be made for the immediate, safe and unhindered provision of humanitarian aid to affected civilians throughout Gaza,” MFA added. The Al-Shifa Hospital has become the main target of Israel’s ground operation.The Israeli military has claimed that Hamas has its headquarters in tunnels beneath the facility, which the Palestinian militant group denies. MFA said that Singapore will continue to work closely with its humanitarian partners to offer additional assistance and support to the Palestinian people. Reuters reported that Gaza health authorities deemed reliable by the UN had said that at least 11,500 people have been confirmed killed, more than 4,700 of them children, in the Israeli bombardment and ground invasion.Since the war began, more than two-thirds of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have fled their homes. There have been limited deliveries of humanitarian relief crossing from Egypt into Gaza since Oct 21.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Hamas, Israel agree deal for release of 50 hostages in exchange for 4-day truce',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Israel and Hamas agreed on Nov 22 to a ceasefire for at least four days to let in aid and allow the release of at least 50 hostages held by Hamas in exchange for some 150 Palestinians jailed in Israel.The first truce in a brutal near seven-week-old war, reached after mediation by Qatar, was hailed around the world as a sign of progress that could ease the suffering of civilians in the Gaza Strip and bring more Israeli hostages home. Israel said the ceasefire could be extended further, as long as more hostages were freed.Hamas is believed to be holding more than 200 hostages, taken when its fighters attacked southern Israel on Oct 7. Some 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli tallies.The first hostages are expected to go free on Nov 23.A statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said 50 women and children would be released over four days at a rate of at least 10 each day.  Beyond that, the truce could be extended, as long as an additional 10 hostages are freed per day.Mr Netanyahu made no mention of the release of Palestinian detainees, but Israel’s Justice Ministry published a list of 300 names of Palestinian prisoners who could be freed.“Israel’s government is committed to return all the hostages home. Tonight, it approved the proposed deal as a first stage to achieving this goal,” said Mr Netanyahu.Hamas said the 50 hostages would be released in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children who are held in Israeli jails. The truce will also allow hundreds of humanitarian, medical and fuel aid trucks to enter all parts of Gaza, the group said in a statement.Israel has committed not to attack or arrest anyone in all parts of Gaza during the truce period, it added.Qatar’s chief negotiator, Minister of State at the Foreign Ministry Mohammed Al-Khulaifi, told Reuters that the truce meant there would be “no attack whatsoever. No military movements, no expansion, nothing”. Qatar hopes the deal “will be a seed to a bigger agreement and a permanent cease of fire, and that’s our intention”, he said.There was no let-up in fighting, pending the start of the truce. As morning broke on Nov 22, smoke from explosions could be seen rising above northern Gaza in live Reuters video footage from across the fence.Israel’s military released footage of soldiers shooting in narrow alleyways and said it had carried out air strikes. It said its “forces continue to operate within the Strip’s territory to destroy terrorist infrastructure, eliminate terrorists and locate weaponry”.At least 14,000 people have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory action, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza. About two-thirds of the coastal enclave’s 2.3 million people are homeless.Both Israel and Hamas said the truce would not halt their broader missions.“We are at war, and we will continue the war until we achieve all our goals. To destroy Hamas, return all our hostages, and ensure that no entity in Gaza can threaten Israel,” Mr Netanyahu said in a recorded message.Hamas said in its statement: “As we announce the striking of a truce agreement, we affirm that our fingers remain on the trigger, and our victorious fighters will remain on the lookout to defend our people and defeat the occupation.”Still, there was some hope of a step towards broader peace.“We hope the truce will happen, and there will be good solutions, and we hope people will live peacefully, return to their homes and workplaces with stability,” said Mr Abu Jihad Shameya, who had taken refuge in the main southern city of Khan Younis after fleeing northern Gaza.“May God not prolong this hardship,” he said.Release to begin on Nov 23United States President Joe Biden said he welcomed the deal. “Today’s deal should bring home additional American hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released,” he said in a statement.Three Americans, including a three-year-old girl whose parents were among those killed during the Oct 7 attack, are expected to be among the hostages to be released, a senior US official said.In addition to Israeli citizens, more than half the hostages hold foreign and dual citizenship from some 40 countries. These include Thailand, Britain, France, Argentina and Chile, Israel’s government has said.Ms Kamelia Hoter Ishay, the grandmother of 13-year-old Gali Tarshansky, who is believed to be held in Gaza, said she would not believe reports of a deal until she gets a call that the teenager was freed.“And then I’ll know that it’s really over, and I can breathe a sigh of relief and say that’s it, it’s over,” she said.Mr Qadura Fares, head of the Commission for Prisoners’ Affairs in the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority, told Reuters that among the more than 7,800 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel were about 85 women and 350 minors. Most were detained without charges or for incidents such as hurling rocks at Israeli soldiers, not for launching militant attacks, he said.The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan\\xa0welcomed the temporary truce.They told reporters in London that the agreement should also ultimately lead to a resumption of talks for a two-state solution.Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, said the humanitarian aid should be sustained and expanded, and it should not later become contingent on further hostage releases.“Whatever humanitarian access now increases as a result of this hostage deal must remain in place and must be built upon,” he said.“There must, at no point, be a reduction in this access based on progress for further release of hostages... Punishing the civilian population of Gaza for the holding of those hostages is absolutely not acceptable.”Hospital ordered to evacuateAs attention focused on the hostage release deal, fighting on the ground raged on.In the occupied West Bank on Nov 22, an Israeli drone strike killed five Palestinians and wounded others in the Tolkurm camp, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.Mr Mounir Al-Barsh, director-general of Gaza’s Health Ministry, told Al Jazeera TV that the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza City. Israel said militants are operating from the facility and threatened to act against them within four hours, he said.Hospitals – including Gaza’s biggest, Al-Shifa – have been rendered virtually inoperable by the war and shortages of critical supplies. Israel claims that Hamas conceals military command posts and fighters within them, a claim that Hamas and hospital staff deny.On Nov 21, Israel also said that its forces had encircled the Jabalia refugee camp, a major urban flashpoint and Hamas militant stronghold.According to the United Nations, most Palestinians in Gaza are registered as refugees because they or their ancestors were displaced by the 1948 war of Israel’s creation.Wafa said 33 people were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli air strike on parts of Jabalia, a congested urban extension of Gaza City where Hamas has been battling advancing Israeli armoured forces.In southern Gaza, Hamas-affiliated media said 10 people were killed and 22 injured by an Israeli air strike on an apartment in Khan Younis.

       "  'Title': 'Israel PM Netanyahu rejects Gaza ceasefire, says it amounts to ‘surrendering to Hamas’',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday a ceasefire in the Israel’s war against Hamas “will not happen”, as the United Nations warned not enough aid was coming in to meet “unprecedented humanitarian needs”.Israeli ground forces fought inside the Gaza Strip and air strikes pounded the besieged Hamas-run Palestinian territory in response to the Oct 7 attack – the deadliest in Israel’s history.The intensifying military operations have sharply heightened fears for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza, where the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says more than 8,300 have been killed.In a briefing to foreign press, Mr Netanyahu said a ceasefire would amount to surrendering to Hamas, whose gunmen killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages, according to the latest Israeli figures.“Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen,” he said, vowing Israel will “fight until this battle is won”.The United States, Israel’s ally, also objected to a ceasefire.“We do not believe that a ceasefire is the right answer right now,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, adding that “pauses” to get aid into Gaza should be considered instead.As Israeli forces battled Hamas militants inside the narrow Palestinian territory and sent tanks to the outskirts of Gaza City, concern has surged about the widening humanitarian crisis.Mr Kirby said Washington was “confident” of increasing the number of aid trucks to Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt to around 100 a day.Limited aid has entered Gaza from Egypt under a US-brokered deal, but its volume has fallen far short of the hundreds of trucks a day aid agencies say are needed.Mr Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, called for the Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs,” he said.Israeli tanks on Gaza highway The Hamas attack set off the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, marked by weeks of withering aerial bombardment and three continuous nights of ground operations centred on northern Gaza, which Israel has told civilians to evacuate.Columns of Israeli tanks and armoured bulldozers were seen churning through the sand, and snipers took positions inside emptied residential buildings, in footage released by the army.Dozens of tanks advanced for more than an hour into the southern fringes of Gaza City and blocked the main north-south highway, “firing at any vehicle that tries to go on it”, an eyewitness told AFP by phone.Air strikes also cratered the road and brought down buildings, residents said, before the tanks withdrew.The Israeli ground forces were supported by heavy fire from the air and artillery, with the army striking more than 600 targets within 24 hours, up from 450 reported by the military a day earlier.Hamas said it had fired anti-tank missiles at two Israeli armoured vehicles and that “blows delivered by the resistance have prevented” Israeli troops from establishing a presence in Gaza.The Israeli military also said a woman soldier was rescued from captivity after an operation in the Hamas-run territory. The release of Ms Ori Megidish was “secured during a ground operation”, the army said, adding that she had been “medically checked” and was “doing well”.Mr Netanyahu said the international community must demand the captives remaining in Gaza “be freed immediately, unconditionally”.Hamas released a video of what it said were three women hostages, seated against a tile wall, although the time and place of the recording could not be verified.One called in an agitated tone for Mr Netanyahu to agree to Hamas’ proposed exchange of the hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Mr Netanyahu decried the clip as “cruel psychological propaganda”.‘Bombing followed us’ The more than 230 hostages – aged between a few months and above 80 – are believed to be held in a network of underground tunnels where Hamas has hid its military infrastructure from Israeli surveillance and air attacks.Israel confirmed the death of one of those missing – German-Israeli Shani Louk, 23, who was captured by Hamas when its gunmen stormed a desert music festival.Fear and desperation have spiralled in Gaza, under weeks of siege that have cut off water, food, fuel and other essentials.Internet access was severed on Friday but restored on Sunday following US pressure, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.“We made clear to the government of Israel over the weekend that communications networks needed to be restored,” he said on Monday. “It is about ensuring that vital information flows, humanitarian coordination continues and families can stay in touch.”The UN reported on Sunday that “thousands of people” had ransacked aid warehouses in Gaza.Donkey carts were lining up to load water, as safe drinking water has become scarce in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.According to the UN, all 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders – despite sheltering thousands of patients and about 117,000 displaced people.“We were displaced from our homes to the hospital,” Gaza City resident Ashraf al-Muzani, 38, said from Al-Quds hospital where he and his family have sheltered for a week. “The bombing followed us,” he added. “We haven’t been able to sleep and our children are so frightened.”‘Highest’ UN death toll Mr Lazzarini said 64 of his colleagues had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, “the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict in such a short time”.Anti-Israel anger has flared across the region and beyond.In Russia’s Muslim-majority Dagestan, police said they had arrested 60 people after a crowd stormed an airport on Sunday to attack passengers arriving from Tel Aviv.And Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the US of being responsible for what he called “deadly chaos” unfolding in the Middle East.Washington has warned Israel’s enemies – in particular Iran-allied groups – not to become more fully involved after a series of attacks across the region. Israel’s military has struck targets in Syria and traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told AFP he was “doing my duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war”.Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank where health officials say about 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire and in settler attacks since the Gaza war started.

       "  'Title': 'Israel-Hamas war won’t affect Paris 2024 Olympic Games security plans: Tony Estanguet',\n",
       "  'Text': 'MUMBAI – The war between Israel and militant group Hamas will not affect the security plans for 2024 Olympics, the chief of the Paris Games organising committee said on Monday.There have been protests linked to the Middle East conflict recently, with France being home to Europe’s largest Muslim and Jewish communities. It was put on its highest security alert on Friday after a teacher was killed in an Islamist attack.French President Emmanuel Macron ordered the deployment of up to 7,000 soldiers for increased security patrols, as bomb alerts forced the evacuation of the Louvre Museum and Palace of Versailles. Security at the Belgian border was also stepped up on Tuesday after a shooting incident in Brussels before a Euro 2024 qualifier between Belgium and Sweden a day earlier.Belgian police on Tuesday shot dead a 45-year-old Tunisian who was suspected of killing two Swedes heading to the match, which was abandoned at half-time.Macron on Tuesday denounced hostage-taking as an “ignominy” after Hamas aired a video of a Franco-Israeli woman it kidnapped.The Elysee presidential palace said Macron “calls for her immediate and unconditional release”, adding: “France is fully mobilised and is working with its partners to free French hostages held by Hamas”.“We will not change our plans with what is happening at the moment because since the beginning we are at the best level in terms of security with Paris 2024,” said Tony Estanguet, the president of the organising committee for the July 26-Aug 11 Games.“We anticipated a lot what we need. From the year 2020, we know very carefully how many people we need venue by venue, day by day and we continue to work with the public authorities to guarantee the security.“So again, I’m very confident because there is a strong commitment coming from our partners to guarantee the security.”French police used tear gas and water cannon to break up a banned rally in support of Palestinian people in Paris recently, as Mr Macron urged the French to remain united and refrain from bringing the Israel-Hamas conflict home.The country has been targeted by a series of terrorist attacks over the years, the worst being a simultaneous assault by gunmen and suicide bombers on entertainment venues and cafes in Paris in November 2015.For the 2024 Olympics, France will deploy some 35,000 security agents and the military to secure the opening ceremony alone, a river parade through the heart of Paris, from threats including drone strikes.Hundreds of thousands of spectators are expected to line the Seine river along the 6km route to watch the delegations sail in a flotilla of boats, from the Austerlitz Bridge to the foot of the Eiffel Tower, in the first Olympic opening ceremony of this size staged outside a stadium.“From the beginning of the journey, security is really a part of the project,” Estanguet said after a Paris 2024 presentation at the International Olympic Committee meeting in Mumbai.“We had a terrorist attack in 2015 and it was in the middle of the beginning of this project. So from the beginning, I think the public authorities with Paris 2024 set security as the No. 1 priority in the success of the Games.” Los Angeles 2028 chairman Casey Wasserman on Monday said he hoped the Olympics could be a “beacon of light and hope” for the world, as he lamented the conflict in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. Wasserman, citing the deaths of 11 Israelis killed by Palestinian gunmen at the 1972 Munich Games, added: “Unfortunately, the Olympics are not immune to the world we live in.“At its worst, it is a platform for hate to express itself on the stage and we will always remember the 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team who were taken hostage and murdered in Munich.“But at its best, it is an opportunity for sport to show the world a better path with peace and unity, and we will always remember the triumph of Jesse Owens in the face of unspeakable evil,” he said.Owens, an African-American track and field athlete, won four gold medals at the Berlin Olympics in 1936, when Germany was under the Nazi regime.

       "  'Text': 'BEIJING – The Palestinian envoy to China called for Beijing to play a role in ending the Israel-Hamas war amid concerns of a wider conflict and rising humanitarian toll. “We would like to have China on board with all other players who can really put an end to this,” Ambassador Fariz Mehdawi told Bloomberg TV in an interview on Monday. He cited moves currently under way by Western officials to try to prevent a spillover, and called on Beijing to play its part, although he did not specify how. “We need to stop what’s going on. People are dying.”The United States and its allies are ratcheting up efforts to prevent a further escalation of the Israel-Hamas war, with President Joe Biden mulling over a trip to Israel. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is back in Israel for a second time since the Oct 7 attacks by Hamas, following talks with Arab leaders.Mr Mehdawi’s comments are the latest in a chorus of voices looking for Beijing to step up its efforts at peacemaking.Speaking with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last Saturday, Mr Blinken urged China to use its influence to prevent other actors from entering the conflict.The Israeli ambassador to China previously called on Beijing to leverage its close relationship with Iran to rein in Hamas, which the European Union and the US have designated a terrorist organisation.Mr Mehdawi downplayed the role of Iran, suggesting “the problem is at home here inside Palestine, inside Israel”.The US has been particularly concerned about Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia group in Lebanon, opening an additional front in the war on Israel’s northern border.Earlier, the US said it held talks with Iran through back channels and warned Teheran against escalating the conflict.China has close relations with Iran, and assisted Teheran in brokering a landmark diplomatic detente with Saudi Arabia earlier in 2023.“Israel’s actions have gone beyond self-defence and it should heed the call of the international community and the Secretary-General of the United Nations to stop its collective punishment of the people in Gaza,” Foreign Minister Wang said during a phone conversation with his Saudi Arabian counterpart, according to a readout from the official Xinhua News Agency.\\xa0Residents in Gaza are bracing themselves for a potential ground assault by the Israel Defence Forces. The United Nations said last Friday that the military had told its staff on the ground that all residents of northern Gaza – roughly half the territory’s population of over two million people – had until midnight to relocate south.It called the task “impossible”.

Hundreds of thousands of army reservists have been called up, leaving a gaping hole in manpower and disrupting supply chains from seaports to supermarkets.\"The war has created a substantial vacuum in the workforce of the high-tech sector. This scenario is especially noticeable in multinational corporations located in Israel, where the percentage of employees recruited to the reserves is significantly higher than the national average,\" Simon said.Simon did not cite figures but the government has estimated as much as 15% of tech workers were called to military service.He said their absence harms both current projects and \"sends a worrying message to their global headquarters about the reliability and stability of their Israeli operations, and of Israel in general\".Simon also pointed to the preceding 10 months of political turmoil amid a judicial overhaul plan that harmed foreign investments and led to a few R&D closures.He cautioned that \"multinational companies may freeze or reduce their investments after the conflict, and even to close their R&D activities here\" which would carry harmful results for Israel\\'s economy and the \"future of innovation, weaken our global position and undermine our internal stability even more\".

For 14 months between 2018 and 2019, I lived in Jerusalem. I wrote my master’s thesis on the 2014 Gaza conflict, which the 2023 conflict is beginning to share many similarities with.\\xa0The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the most intractable in the world, and the worst case of identity politics I have ever seen.\\xa0I spoke with Israelis and Palestinians when I travelled through Israel and the West Bank. I frequently found that each side saw the conflict in binary terms, as a struggle of “us versus them”, of “good guys” versus “bad guys”.\\xa0\\xa0A\\xa02014 study\\xa0in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal called this phenomenon “motive attribution asymmetry”. Each side sees its own group as motivated by love, while seeing the other side as motivated by hate.\\xa0What I learnt from my conversations was that both Israelis and Palestinians have their own narratives of exile, marginalisation, discrimination, violence and loss. They were speaking about the conflict through the lens of their deep pain, and it was impossible not to feel their anguish.\\xa0The experience taught me to reject an “us versus them” mentality, and instead to see the common humanity in all people, with all the complexities of human nature.\\xa0Thus, it is heartening to see how Jews, Muslims and people of other faiths in Singapore have modelled this same commitment. At the recent Inter-Religious Organisation event, they transcended their different beliefs to affirm a common desire for peace in the Middle East, and to also pray for the peace and safety of civilians in Israel and Gaza, including those being held hostage.\\xa0\\xa0The challenge of the Middle East conflict calls on us to bring out the best of ourselves to deal with the worst impulses of human nature.\\xa0\\xa0Both Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in peace and security. We must continue to reject all forms of violence against civilians and strive for peaceful coexistence, or else many more precious lives will continue to be lost.\\xa0Darius Lee ',\n",

       "  'Text': 'WASHINGTON  -The White House on Thursday said it was exploring a series of pauses in the Israel-Hamas conflict to help people safely exit Gaza and allow humanitarian aid to get in, but reiterated its opposition to a full ceasefire.National security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that such pauses should be temporary and localized, and insisted they would not stop Israel from defending itself.\"What we\\'re trying to do is explore the idea of as many pauses as might be necessary to continue to get aid out and to continue to work to get people out safely, including hostages,\" he told reporters at a regular White House briefing. President Joe Biden spoke on Wednesday about the need for a pause to provide time for the release of hostages held by Hamas, but has ruled out calling for a full ceasefire.His fellow Democrat, Senator Dick Durbin, on Thursday told CNN it was time for a ceasefire, while Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, called for a humanitarian pause to allow critical aid to reach civilians.United Nations experts are also urging a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, saying time is running out for Palestinian people there who find themselves at \"grave risk of genocide.\"Israel says it is aiming its attacks at Hamas, not civilians, and accuses the group of using them as human shields.Nearly four weeks of Israeli bombardment against the Gaza Strip in retaliation for deadly attacks by Hamas gunmen in southern Israel on Oct. 7 have killed at least 9,061 people, made up of a majority of women and children, health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave say.The White House on Thursday said 79 of its citizens have left the Gaza Strip in the two days since a crossing opened to Egypt, and it hoped more could be released in coming days, but conceded the situation remained \"fluid.\"Kirby told reporters that 55 more aid trucks were expected to enter Gaza on Thursday, bringing the total to more than 220, but said increasing aid remained a top priority for Biden.He said the United States was speaking with Israel daily and urging it to avoid civilian casualties. He noted that U.S. military officers had traveled to Israel to share lessons learned in past urban conflicts but they had since returned home, and Washington was not helping Israel with its targeting.\"There are things you can do from the ground that you can\\'t do from the air, particularly if you have good intelligence,\" he said, without elaborating.\"We\\'re doing everything we can to work with our Israeli counterparts to try to minimize the risk of civilian deaths and collateral damage,\" Kirby said. \"We are giving them the tools, including perspective and advice but also weapons, to be able to conduct these operations in the most efficient way possible, and in a way that minimizes civilian harm.\"Kirby said the scope of Israel\\'s operations showed \"they are making efforts to try to minimize civilian casualties,\" adding it was clear that some casualties were still occurring.Asked if the United States bore responsibility for civilian deaths if it was providing such weapons, Kirby insisted that Washington was not \"making the targeting decisions.\" REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'THE HAGUE - Conflict between Israel and Palestinian forces since militant group Hamas\\' weekend assault have created a huge and rising death toll on both sides.The war falls under a complex international system of justice that has emerged since World War Two.What laws govern the conflict?Internationally accepted rules of armed conflict emerged out of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which have been ratified by all UN member states and supplemented by rulings at international war crimes tribunals.A series of treaties governs the treatment of civilians, soldiers and prisoners of war in a system collectively known as the \"Law of Armed Conflict\" or \"International Humanitarian Law\". It applies to government forces and organised armed groups, including Hamas militants.If alleged Palestinian perpetrators of atrocities in Israel and all alleged perpetrators of crimes on the occupied Palestinian territories are not brought to justice at home, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is the only international legal organ able to bring charges. Domestic courts can apply so-called universal jurisdiction in war crimes cases, but that would be limited in scope.The ICC\\'s founding Rome Statute gives it legal authority to investigate alleged crimes on the territory of its members or by their nationals, when domestic authorities are \"unwilling or unable\" to do so.On Tuesday, the office of the prosecutor of the ICC confirmed that its mandate applies to potential crimes committed in the current conflict and said it continues to gather information.What is the role of the ICC?The International Criminal Court (ICC), the world\\'s permanent war crimes tribunals, opened in The Hague in 2002. It has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in its 123 member states or committed by its nationals.Many of the world\\'s major powers are not members, including China, the United States, Russia, India and Egypt. The ICC recognises Palestine as a member state, while Israel rejects the court\\'s jurisdiction and does not formally engage with it. With a limited budget and staff, ICC prosecutors are already investigating 17 cases ranging from Ukraine and Afghanistan to Sudan and Myanmar. The ICC budget has allocated less than 100,000 euros ($106,000) for investigations in the Palestinian territories for 2023 and is seeking additional resources.The ICC has had an ongoing investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the occupied Palestinian territories since 2021. It has not issued any arrest warrants.Prosecutors said in 2021 there was a reasonable basis to believe that violations had been committed on all sides, including by Israeli troops, Hamas militants and other armed Palestinian groups.What acts could violate war crimes law?New York-based Human Rights Watch cited as possible war crimes the deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate rocket attacks, and the taking of civilians as hostages by Palestinian armed groups, as well as the Israeli counter-strikes in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians.\"Deliberate killings of civilians, hostage-taking, and collective punishment are heinous crimes that have no justification,\" said Omar Shakir, the group\\'s Israel and Palestine director.The taking of hostages, murder and torture are explicitly banned under the Geneva Conventions, while Israel\\'s response could also be subject to a war crimes investigation. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant drew criticism from U.N. officials and human rights groups by announcing a tightened blockade to prevent food and fuel from reaching the Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million people.Do the Geneva Conventions apply?Israel has a right and duty to respond, US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday, adding that he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had discussed “how democracies like Israel and the United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law.”A siege can be considered a war crime if it targets civilians, rather than a legitimate means to undermine Hamas\\' military capabilities, or if found to be disproportionate.Attacks on military objectives have to be proportional under international law which means they must not lead to excessive loss of civilian life or damage to civilian objects in relation to the direct and concrete military advantage expected.Mr Nick Kaufman, a British-born Israeli defence lawyer at the ICC, cited the gruesome killings by Hamas militants of hundreds of revellers at a dance rave and civilians in several Kibbutz communities near the Gaza border as an obvious focus for a war crimes case.

       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM - Israel\\'s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday to \"demolish Hamas\" as his troops prepared to move into the Gaza Strip in pursuit of Hamas militants whose deadly rampage through Israeli border towns shocked the world.Israel has urged exhausted Gazans to evacuate the south, which hundreds of thousands have already done in the besieged enclave that is home to more than 2 million people. Hamas, which runs Gaza, has told people to ignore Israel\\'s message. Inside Gaza\\'s narrow and crowded streets, conditions were deteriorating as deaths from Israeli air strikes rose. Bodies were stored in ice cream freezer trucks because moving them to hospitals was too risky and cemeteries were full.With fears of the conflict spilling further, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken continued his tour of Middle East states, seeking to prevent escalation and secure the release of 155 hostages Israel says were taken by Hamas back into Gaza.Arab leaders stressed the need to protect Gaza civilians.\"The reaction went beyond the right to self-defence, turning into collective punishment,\" said Egypt\\'s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Israel\\'s retaliatory strikes.Clashes on Israel\\'s border with Lebanon, the deadliest since 2006, have underscored the dangers of regional spillover. On Sunday, Hamas\\' armed wing Al Qassam Brigades said it fired 20 rockets from Lebanon at two Israeli settlements while Lebanon\\'s Hezbollah militia said it fired missiles at Israeli barracks in Hanita and had inflicted casualties.Israel said it was striking Lebanon in retaliation, and the UN peacekeeping force said its headquarters in south Lebanon had been hit by a rocket.Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, warned Israel of escalation if it kept attacking Palestinians. \"If the Zionist aggressions do not stop, the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger,\" said Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, adding that Teheran could not simply stay an observer.Mr Blinken met Saudi Arabia\\'s Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh then Sisi in Cairo. Amid international efforts to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Mr Blinken said the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt would reopen. \"There\\'s a determination in every country I went to, to make sure that this conflict doesn\\'t spread,\" said Mr Blinken, who was due back in Israel on Monday.\"They are using their own influence, their own relationships, to try to make sure that this doesn\\'t happen.\" ISRAELI RESOLVEMr Netanyahu convened Israel\\'s expanded emergency Cabinet, including former opposition lawmakers, in a show of unity. \"Hamas thought we would be demolished. It is we who will demolish Hamas,\" he said.Israel is carrying out the most intense bombardment Gaza has ever seen in response to the killing of 1,300 people when Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct 7. They shot men, women, children and soldiers and seized hostages in the worst attack on civilians in Israel\\'s history.Graphic video of the attacks, and reports from medical and emergency services in the overrun towns and kibbutzes, deepened Israelis\\' sense of shock. France said 19 of its citizens had died in the Hamas attacks, with 13 others still unaccounted for and possibly taken hostage. Canada raised its fatality toll to five.Authorities in Gaza said at least 2,670 people had so far been killed by Israel\\'s retaliatory strikes, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded. Another 1,000 people were missing and believed to be under rubble.Gaza hospitals are running short of supplies and struggling to cope with the numbers of wounded.Among them was four-year-old Fulla Al-Laham, 14 members of whose family, including her parents and siblings, died in an Israeli air strike. \"May God keep me alive to take care of her,\" said her grandmother Um Muhammed Al-Laham, who held the girl\\'s hand as she lay in a hospital on a drip with a bandaged arm.ON THE MOVEIsrael\\'s military, which has massed tanks on Gaza\\'s border in preparation for a ground offensive, says it is targeting Hamas and its infrastructure. Israeli aircraft on Sunday struck about 250 military targets, killing the Hamas southern district commander, the military said.Israeli military chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi told soldiers near the Gaza border they would be entering Gaza to root out Hamas, targeting \"every place, every commander, every operator.\"\"You are about to do something big and important, that needs to change the situation for a long time in a clear way,\" Mr Halevi said.An Israeli blockade has prevented fuel, food and water from entering Gaza, although Netanyahu had agreed with US President Joe Biden to resume the water supply to parts of southern Gaza, a minister said on Sunday. The Israeli military said some 600,000 Gazans had left the northern half of the territory, which includes Gaza City\\'s more than 1 million residents.Some Palestinians who went south said they were heading back north because they were attacked wherever they went.Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, an intensive care doctor on a children\\'s ward at the Kamal Edwan hospital in northern Gaza, said the order to evacuate was impossible.\"In this ward as you can see, there are children who are attached to ventilators, and now we have been asked to evacuate the hospital, where should we evacuate these children?\"The World Health Organization said Israel\\'s orders to evacuate 22 Gaza hospitals were a \"death sentence for the sick and injured\". UN relief operations in Gaza \"are on the verge of collapse,\" said Mr Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the UN agency for the Palestinians, UNRWA.\"The number of people seeking shelter in our schools and other UNRWA facilities in the south is absolutely overwhelming, and we do not have any more the capacity to deal with them,\" he said.

       "  'Title': \"Hamas' cash-to-crypto global finance maze in Israel's sights\",\n",
       "  'Text': 'LONDON/DUBAI  -     Palestinian militant group Hamas uses a global financing network to funnel support from charities and friendly nations, passing cash through Gaza tunnels or using cryptocurrencies to bypass international sanctions, according to experts and officials.However, Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, will face even more obstacles accessing funds after the rampage by the group\\'s gunmen that killed hundreds of Israelis, mainly civilians. Israel has responded with the heaviest bombardment of Gaza in 75 years of conflict.Earlier this week, Israeli police said they froze a Barclays bank account the authorities said was linked to Hamas fundraising and blocked cryptocurrency accounts used to gather donations, without specifying how many accounts or the value of the assets.The move provided a glimpse of a complex financial web, some legitimate, much hidden, that underpins Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, and its government in the Gaza Strip, which it has run since 2007.Matthew Levitt, a former U.S. official specialised in counterterrorism, estimated the bulk of Hamas\\' budget of more than $300 million came from taxes on business, as well as from countries including Iran and Qatar or charities.Last February, the State Department said that Hamas raises funds in other Gulf countries and gets donations from Palestinians, other expatriates and its own charities.Reuters was unable to reach Hamas officials for comment for this story. In the past, Hamas has said financial restrictions placed on its donors were an attempt to neutralise legitimate resistance against Israel.Hamas, sanctioned as a terrorist organization by the United States and countries such as Britain, had increasingly used cryptocurrencies, credit cards or contrived trade deals to avoid mounting international restrictions, Levitt said.\"Hamas has been one of the more successful users of crypto for the financing\\xa0of terrorism,\" said Tom Robinson, co-founder of blockchain research firm Elliptic.However, this year Hamas said it would back away from crypto, after a spate of losses. Cryptocurrency\\'s ledger system can make such transactions traceable.Blockchain researchers TRM Labs said this week in a research note that crypto fundraising has previously increased following rounds of violence involving Hamas. After fighting in May 2021, Hamas-controlled crypto addresses received more than $400,000, TRM Labs said.However, since last weekend\\'s violence, prominent Hamas-linked support groups had moved just a few thousands dollars through crypto, TRM noted.\"One likely reason for the low donation volume is that Israeli authorities are targeting them immediately,\" TRM said, adding that Israel had seized cryptocurrency worth \"tens of millions of dollars\" from Hamas-linked addresses in recent years.Between Dec. 2021 and April this year, Israel seized almost 190 crypto accounts it said were linked to Hamas.SHIPS AND SHELLSWhether through crypto or other means, Hamas\\' allies have found ways to get money to Gaza. The U.S. State Department has said that Iran provides up to $100 million annually in support to Palestinian groups including Hamas, and has cited methods of moving the money through shell companies, shipping transactions and precious metals.  Iranian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.By last year, Hamas had established a secret network of companies managing $500 million of investments in companies from Turkey to Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Treasury has said, announcing sanctions on the firms in May, 2022.Israel has long accused Iran\\'s clerical rulers of stoking violence by supplying arms to Hamas. Tehran, which does not recognise Israel, says it gives moral and financial support to the group.Backing the Palestinian cause has been a pillar of the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution and a way for the country to fashion itself as a leader of the Muslim world.     Gas-rich Qatar too has paid hundreds of millions of dollars to Gaza since 2014, at one point spending $30 million per month to help operate the enclave\\'s sole power plant and to support needy families and public servants in the Hamas-run government. \"Qatari aid provides 100 dollars to the poorest Palestinian families and extends the period of electricity during a day in Gaza,\" a Qatari official said in response to a request for government comment, adding that it had helped \"maintain stability and quality of life for ... Palestinian families\".Qatar walks a foreign policy tightrope, hosting the region\\'s largest U.S. military base, the Taliban and other groups, often allowing it to mediate.CASH RULESQatar\\'s funding for Gaza actually passes through Israel, a source familiar with the process said. The funds are transferred electronically from Qatar to Israel. Israeli and U.N. officials hand-carry cash over the border to Gaza.The cash is distributed directly to needy families and public servants in Gaza and each family or individual must sign next to their name that they\\'ve received the cash. One copy of that sheet goes to Israel, one goes to the UN and one goes to Qatar.\"Qatari aid to the Gaza Strip is fully coordinated with Israel, the UN and the U.S.,\" the Qatari government official said.In recent years, Qatar bought fuel from Israel for Gaza\\'s sole power station. It also sent Egyptian fuel that Hamas can resell, using the proceeds for salaries. Stephen Reimer of the think tank, Royal United Services Institute, predicted fresh attempts to fully restrict the group\\'s access to formal financial channels would have limited success. \"Their financing tactics have grown to circumvent these.\" REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'More questions than answers as Israeli PM Netanyahu seeks security control over Gaza',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s declaration this week that Israel would take control of security in Gaza for an indefinite period has added to uncertainty over the future of the besieged enclave, more than a month into the war.Israeli officials have since tried to make clear that they do not intend to reoccupy Gaza, from which Israeli forces withdrew in 2005. But there has been no clarity on how to ensure security without maintaining a military presence in the territory.Only one thing has been stressed repeatedly – Hamas must be destroyed.The movement launched an attack on southern Israel on Oct 7, which Israel says killed 1,400 people. Hamas also took more than 240 hostages.Israel responded to that attack with retaliatory strikes on Gaza, which is ruled by Hamas. Israel’s bombardments have killed more than 10,500 Palestinians.“They cannot be here,” former defence minister Benny Gantz, who joined Mr Netanyahu in an emergency unity government in October, said on Wednesday. “We can come up with any mechanism we think is appropriate, but Hamas will not be part of it.”Mr Gantz, who said Hamas presented an existential threat to Israel, told reporters that Israel would have to ensure “security superiority” around Gaza, but the specifics remain vague in the absence of any coherent idea of the political future.Mr Ron Dermer, one of Mr Netanyahu’s closest aides, who like Mr Gantz is in the inner war Cabinet, said Israel would have to play an active role in the oversight of Gaza.But he said that much would depend on how the enclave was governed in future.“Will there be a force that will prevent terrorism from emerging there? Will there be a Palestinian force that will build and govern Gaza the way it should for the people of Gaza, and not just to destroy Israel? That remains to be seen,” he told US network NBC on Tuesday.The war is already among the bloodiest episodes in decades of conflict.Whole swathes of the densely populated coastal strip have been flattened.More than 1.5 million people, some two-thirds of the population, have been forced from their homes, according to United Nations figures.Rebuilding the physical infrastructure and reconstructing the governance of the area will present a colossal challenge which will force Israel to work with the Palestinians, diplomats say, despite the bitter enmity on both sides.As the war continues, there have been calls from Western countries, including the United States, for a renewal of stalled efforts to agree on a two-state solution, with an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a news conference in Tokyo: “Now, the reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict, but it is imperative that Palestinian people (be) central to governance in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.“It is also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza.”Challenges aheadIsrael originally withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, drawing the wrath of hardline settlers who were forced to leave with the army when former prime minister Ariel Sharon decided the costs of maintaining a presence were too high.The challenges that are likely to confront any reshaped Israeli security mechanism have already been clearly demonstrated during more than 18 months of increasingly violent clashes in the nearby occupied West Bank.Some diplomats have mooted the possibility of a reshaped Palestinian Authority (PA) playing a role in the administration of Gaza, if Israel succeeds in its aim of dismantling Hamas.The PA used to run both Gaza and the West Bank, but was forcibly ousted from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. It now governs only sections of the West Bank, which is dotted with ever-growing Jewish settlements. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh recently told foreign reporters that the PA would not return to Gaza “on the back of an Israeli tank”.Those comments threw serious doubt on speculation that Israel will seek to offload responsibility for the day-to-day running of the enclave onto its previous masters. In any case, the PA has long struggled to impose its authority even in the West Bank. In theory, it is responsible for order in the area, but it is mistrusted by both Israel and large sections of the Palestinian population. In its place, the Israeli army has largely taken the job of combating militant activity.Over the past 18 months, Israeli troops have killed hundreds of Palestinians – hardened militant fighters, stone-throwing young people and uninvolved civilians – and made thousands of arrests across the West Bank. In the same period, dozens of Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians.Cities such as Nablus and Jenin, which earlier in 2023 was the scene of a two-day battle involving hundreds of Israeli troops backed by drones and helicopter gunships, have become strongholds for militant groups including Hamas.Mr Dermer said that while Israeli troops had physically entered West Bank towns, they had essentially been absent from Gaza for the last 17 years.  “Obviously, we can’t repeat (this). So, after Hamas is removed from power... Israel is going to have to retain over-riding security responsibility indefinitely.”Jordan’s former deputy prime minister, Mr Marwan Muasher, told Reuters he had seen no convincing initiative on how Gaza might be governed once the conflict ended.“I don’t think that there is any clear thinking yet about what to do with the day after,” said Mr Muasher, who is vice-president for studies at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

       "  'Text': 'PARIS – Countries around the world have reacted to a wave of attacks by land, sea and air carried out by Palestinian armed group Hamas that Israel says has claimed hundreds of lives. The statements by world leaders ranged from outright condemnation of the attacks and strong support for Israel from Western nations, to support for Hamas from some Middle Eastern countries. Many have called for a de-escalation of the conflict, after Israel launched air strikes and other military operations targeting Gaza that the Palestinian authorities say have killed hundreds.Here is a round-up of the reactions:United States President Joe Biden said US support for Israel was “rock solid and unwavering”. On Sunday, he ordered US ships and warplanes to move closer to Israel.Washington also promised to provide munitions and equipment to Israel, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on Sunday.Several US citizens were among those killed in Hamas’ surprise attack, according to a US National Security Council spokesperson.Iran President Ebrahim Raisi said on Sunday that Iran supported the Palestinians’ right to self-defence, and warned that Israel must be held accountable for endangering the region.A senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had already backed the attack last Saturday, calling it a “proud operation”.Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry called for “an immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, protection of civilians and self-control”.United Nations The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday, a day after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged diplomatic efforts in the Middle East to prevent wider conflict.Diplomats said the Security Council did not consider any joint statement, let alone a binding resolution, with members led by Russia hoping for a broader focus than condemning Hamas.European Union European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had already condemned the attack by Hamas last Saturday.On Sunday, she posted on X, formerly Twitter: “The full scale of the brutality of the Hamas terror attack leaves us breathless. “Defenceless people, brutally murdered in cold blood on the streets. We stand strong with Israel and its people. Today, the EU and Israeli flags fly side by side.”China “China is deeply concerned about the current escalation of tension and violence between Palestine and Israel,” a Foreign Ministry statement said on Sunday. Beijing “calls on all parties concerned to remain calm and exercise restraint, cease fire immediately, protect civilians and prevent further deterioration of the situation”, it added.Russia Russia’s Foreign Ministry called for an “immediate ceasefire” and negotiations towards “a comprehensive, lasting and long-awaited peace”, said spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is fending off a Russian invasion, said on Sunday that he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to offer condolences “for the numerous casualties caused by the terrorist attack”.He said last Saturday that Israel had an indisputable right to defend itself, adding that “terror is always a crime”.South Africa The ruling African National Congress issued a statement on Sunday saying: “It can no longer be disputed that apartheid South Africa’s history is occupied Palestine’s reality.“As a result, the decision by Palestinians to respond to the brutality of the settler Israeli apartheid regime is unsurprising.”The statement added it was clear that “the degenerating security situation is directly linked to the unlawful Israeli occupation”.France French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna held talks by telephone with several of her counterparts in the Middle East in a bid to “prevent the conflict degenerating” by spreading to other parts of the region, a ministry statement said on Sunday.France’s Foreign Ministry also called for the immediate release of the hostages taken by Hamas.Germany German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sunday that Israel has the right to defend itself against “barbaric attacks” and “to protect its citizens and to pursue the attackers”.He called Mr Netanyahu to tell him Germany stands “firmly and unwaveringly by Israel’s side”. German-Israeli nationals are among the hostages taken by Hamas, a Foreign Ministry source confirmed.Britain British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Sunday he had assured Mr Netanyahu of London’s “steadfast support”.“We will do everything that we can to help. Terrorism will not prevail,” he added in a statement.Turkey Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday urged Israel and Hamas “to support peace” and refrain from harming civilians.“There is no good in (attacking) civilians,” he said. “We are ready to do everything to reduce the tension.”Italy Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called Mr Netanyahu to reaffirm “Rome’s full solidarity” following the Hamas offensive. “Italy stands by the Israeli people at this difficult time,” said a government statement.Japan Japan “strongly condemns” the attacks, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa said on Sunday, as well as the taking of hostages by Hamas.“Meanwhile, we are seriously concerned about the large number of casualties in the Gaza Strip as a result of attacks by the Israel Defence Forces,” her statement continued, calling for restraint.Vatican City Pope Francis on Sunday said that “terrorism and war do not lead to any resolutions, but only to the death and suffering of so many innocent people.“War is a defeat! Every war is a defeat! Let us pray that there be peace in Israel and in Palestine”.India Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India stands “in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour”. “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel,” he said.Venezuela Venezuela’s government expressed its “deep concern” over the clashes.In a statement on X, it said the fighting was “the result of the impossibility of the Palestinian people to find in multilateral international legality a space to assert their historic rights”.Yemen In Yemen, Huthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa expressed their support for “the heroic jihadist operation”. In a statement on the website of the Huthi-controlled Saba news agency, the Iran-aligned militant group said the attack “revealed the weakness, fragility and impotence” of Israel. AFP',\n",

       "  'Text': 'BEIJING – The Palestinian envoy to China called for Beijing to play a role in ending the Israel-Hamas war amid concerns of a wider conflict and rising humanitarian toll. “We would like to have China on board with all other players who can really put an end to this,” Ambassador Fariz Mehdawi told Bloomberg TV in an interview on Monday. He cited moves currently under way by Western officials to try to prevent a spillover, and called on Beijing to play its part, although he did not specify how. “We need to stop what’s going on. People are dying.”The United States and its allies are ratcheting up efforts to prevent a further escalation of the Israel-Hamas war, with President Joe Biden mulling over a trip to Israel. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is back in Israel for a second time since the Oct 7 attacks by Hamas, following talks with Arab leaders.Mr Mehdawi’s comments are the latest in a chorus of voices looking for Beijing to step up its efforts at peacemaking.Speaking with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last Saturday, Mr Blinken urged China to use its influence to prevent other actors from entering the conflict.The Israeli ambassador to China previously called on Beijing to leverage its close relationship with Iran to rein in Hamas, which the European Union and the US have designated a terrorist organisation.Mr Mehdawi downplayed the role of Iran, suggesting “the problem is at home here inside Palestine, inside Israel”.The US has been particularly concerned about Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia group in Lebanon, opening an additional front in the war on Israel’s northern border.Earlier, the US said it held talks with Iran through back channels and warned Teheran against escalating the conflict.China has close relations with Iran, and assisted Teheran in brokering a landmark diplomatic detente with Saudi Arabia earlier in 2023.“Israel’s actions have gone beyond self-defence and it should heed the call of the international community and the Secretary-General of the United Nations to stop its collective punishment of the people in Gaza,” Foreign Minister Wang said during a phone conversation with his Saudi Arabian counterpart, according to a readout from the official Xinhua News Agency.\\xa0Residents in Gaza are bracing themselves for a potential ground assault by the Israel Defence Forces. The United Nations said last Friday that the military had told its staff on the ground that all residents of northern Gaza – roughly half the territory’s population of over two million people – had until midnight to relocate south.It called the task “impossible”.

       "  'Title': 'Hamas, Israel agree deal for release of 50 hostages in exchange for 4-day truce',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Israel and Hamas agreed on Nov 22 to a ceasefire for at least four days to let in aid and allow the release of at least 50 hostages held by Hamas in exchange for some 150 Palestinians jailed in Israel.The first truce in a brutal near seven-week-old war, reached after mediation by Qatar, was hailed around the world as a sign of progress that could ease the suffering of civilians in the Gaza Strip and bring more Israeli hostages home. Israel said the ceasefire could be extended further, as long as more hostages were freed.Hamas is believed to be holding more than 200 hostages, taken when its fighters attacked southern Israel on Oct 7. Some 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli tallies.The first hostages are expected to go free on Nov 23.A statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said 50 women and children would be released over four days at a rate of at least 10 each day.  Beyond that, the truce could be extended, as long as an additional 10 hostages are freed per day.Mr Netanyahu made no mention of the release of Palestinian detainees, but Israel’s Justice Ministry published a list of 300 names of Palestinian prisoners who could be freed.“Israel’s government is committed to return all the hostages home. Tonight, it approved the proposed deal as a first stage to achieving this goal,” said Mr Netanyahu.Hamas said the 50 hostages would be released in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children who are held in Israeli jails. The truce will also allow hundreds of humanitarian, medical and fuel aid trucks to enter all parts of Gaza, the group said in a statement.Israel has committed not to attack or arrest anyone in all parts of Gaza during the truce period, it added.Qatar’s chief negotiator, Minister of State at the Foreign Ministry Mohammed Al-Khulaifi, told Reuters that the truce meant there would be “no attack whatsoever. No military movements, no expansion, nothing”. Qatar hopes the deal “will be a seed to a bigger agreement and a permanent cease of fire, and that’s our intention”, he said.There was no let-up in fighting, pending the start of the truce. As morning broke on Nov 22, smoke from explosions could be seen rising above northern Gaza in live Reuters video footage from across the fence.Israel’s military released footage of soldiers shooting in narrow alleyways and said it had carried out air strikes. It said its “forces continue to operate within the Strip’s territory to destroy terrorist infrastructure, eliminate terrorists and locate weaponry”.At least 14,000 people have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory action, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza. About two-thirds of the coastal enclave’s 2.3 million people are homeless.Both Israel and Hamas said the truce would not halt their broader missions.“We are at war, and we will continue the war until we achieve all our goals. To destroy Hamas, return all our hostages, and ensure that no entity in Gaza can threaten Israel,” Mr Netanyahu said in a recorded message.Hamas said in its statement: “As we announce the striking of a truce agreement, we affirm that our fingers remain on the trigger, and our victorious fighters will remain on the lookout to defend our people and defeat the occupation.”Still, there was some hope of a step towards broader peace.“We hope the truce will happen, and there will be good solutions, and we hope people will live peacefully, return to their homes and workplaces with stability,” said Mr Abu Jihad Shameya, who had taken refuge in the main southern city of Khan Younis after fleeing northern Gaza.“May God not prolong this hardship,” he said.Release to begin on Nov 23United States President Joe Biden said he welcomed the deal. “Today’s deal should bring home additional American hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released,” he said in a statement.Three Americans, including a three-year-old girl whose parents were among those killed during the Oct 7 attack, are expected to be among the hostages to be released, a senior US official said.In addition to Israeli citizens, more than half the hostages hold foreign and dual citizenship from some 40 countries. These include Thailand, Britain, France, Argentina and Chile, Israel’s government has said.Ms Kamelia Hoter Ishay, the grandmother of 13-year-old Gali Tarshansky, who is believed to be held in Gaza, said she would not believe reports of a deal until she gets a call that the teenager was freed.“And then I’ll know that it’s really over, and I can breathe a sigh of relief and say that’s it, it’s over,” she said.Mr Qadura Fares, head of the Commission for Prisoners’ Affairs in the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority, told Reuters that among the more than 7,800 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel were about 85 women and 350 minors. Most were detained without charges or for incidents such as hurling rocks at Israeli soldiers, not for launching militant attacks, he said.The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan\\xa0welcomed the temporary truce.They told reporters in London that the agreement should also ultimately lead to a resumption of talks for a two-state solution.Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, said the humanitarian aid should be sustained and expanded, and it should not later become contingent on further hostage releases.“Whatever humanitarian access now increases as a result of this hostage deal must remain in place and must be built upon,” he said.“There must, at no point, be a reduction in this access based on progress for further release of hostages... Punishing the civilian population of Gaza for the holding of those hostages is absolutely not acceptable.”Hospital ordered to evacuateAs attention focused on the hostage release deal, fighting on the ground raged on.In the occupied West Bank on Nov 22, an Israeli drone strike killed five Palestinians and wounded others in the Tolkurm camp, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.Mr Mounir Al-Barsh, director-general of Gaza’s Health Ministry, told Al Jazeera TV that the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza City. Israel said militants are operating from the facility and threatened to act against them within four hours, he said.Hospitals – including Gaza’s biggest, Al-Shifa – have been rendered virtually inoperable by the war and shortages of critical supplies. Israel claims that Hamas conceals military command posts and fighters within them, a claim that Hamas and hospital staff deny.On Nov 21, Israel also said that its forces had encircled the Jabalia refugee camp, a major urban flashpoint and Hamas militant stronghold.According to the United Nations, most Palestinians in Gaza are registered as refugees because they or their ancestors were displaced by the 1948 war of Israel’s creation.Wafa said 33 people were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli air strike on parts of Jabalia, a congested urban extension of Gaza City where Hamas has been battling advancing Israeli armoured forces.In southern Gaza, Hamas-affiliated media said 10 people were killed and 22 injured by an Israeli air strike on an apartment in Khan Younis.

       "  'Text': 'NEW YORK – Palestinian Americans and aid groups in the United States are raising funds for Gaza, which faces a deepening humanitarian crisis as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth week – but they have as yet limited ability to get supplies into the besieged enclave.Aid organisations that serve civilians in Gaza say they are receiving record amounts of donations in a sign of public support for relief efforts, even as a growing stock of supplies remains stalled at Egypt’s Rafah border crossing.In the Gaza Strip, where 2.3 million people live, civilians are in dire need of clean water, food and medicine, emergency medics say. Half of Gaza’s population was already living in poverty before the crisis.“We’ve seen a significant increase in donations, unlike (anything) we’ve ever seen before,” said Mr Steve Sosebee, president of the US-based Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which has a staff headcount of 40 in Gaza, who provide medical support.He said the fund, which usually has an annual budget of around US$12 million (S$16.45 million), had raised US$15 million in just 10 days.However, with a web of political and logistical obstacles on getting aid in, much of the money and supplies intended for Gaza is in limbo, forcing aid groups to wait as they amass truckloads of goods.Hamas militants burst over the Gaza border and rampaged through Israeli towns on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people and taking 229 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.In response, Israel launched its most intense air bombardment campaign on the tiny enclave, along with a “total siege”, banning food, water and fuel imports.Aid groups say they are building up supplies in hopes of eventually getting them through to civilians in Gaza, nearly half of whom are children.There has been “a five-fold increase in the total number of donors versus typical past emergencies”, said Mr Derek Madsen, chief development\\xa0officer of Anera, a non-partisan emergency relief group for refugees throughout the Middle East.The organisation, which maintains the privacy of individual donors, said it had recently received the largest single donation from an individual in its 55-year history.The majority of support comes from donors based in the US, he added, with individual donations averaging around US$138. The efforts mirror those of Jewish groups in the US and Canada, who also fundraised millions for Israel.Anera was using the last of its stocks this week to distribute meals and vegetable parcels in Gaza. Its staff of 12, like everyone in Gaza, were facing “unbelievable, unimaginable trauma”, he said.Glued to the televisionIn Ann Arbor, Michigan, Ms Rabia Shafie, national director of the Palestine Aid Society, said her group was speaking to student and Muslim groups on local university campuses and community centres to spread awareness and raise donations for the Red Crescent and UNRWA, the United Nations aid agency that serves Palestinian refugees.“The money is needed to help people survive at this point of time. Medical support is so essential,” she said.“People are glued to the television... watching the news moment to moment, and very stressed out over the situation,” said Ms Rabia, adding that it was difficult as a Palestinian American to watch “the massacre and injustice done to our people back home”.Hamas-governed Gaza is one of the most densely packed places on Earth, and its medical authorities say over 8,000 Palestinians have been killed since air strikes began, including more than 3,000 children.Mr Madsen called for a ceasefire and establishment of a humanitarian corridor “so that people literally do not starve to death, literally do not die of dehydration”.Last week, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, home to one of New York’s largest Muslim and Arab communities, hundreds of protesters called for a ceasefire with signs written in Arabic, Spanish, Hebrew and Korean.In Clifton, New Jersey, the Palestinian American Community Centre’s priorities are calling for US officials to support a ceasefire, and the hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza, said Ms Basma Bsharat, the education director of the centre.The centre has also been collecting cash donations to send on to UNRWA. It has asked people not to donate supplies, which it has no easy way of sending to those in need in Gaza.Last week, a woman came to the centre anyway, hauling bags filled with goods.  “We didn’t know how to say no,” said Ms Basma. “She was like, I just want to do something. I just want to help somehow.”“It’s a very difficult time, and the fact that we do see the support coming in it, it gives some relief,” she said. “It gives some kind of solace.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The nightmare of delivering aid during this Israel-Hamas war',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The 2.3 million people who live in Gaza are facing economic isolation and experiencing incessant bombardment. Their supplies of essential resources, including food and water, are quickly dwindling.In response, US President Joe Biden has pledged US$100 million (S$136 million) in humanitarian assistance for the citizens of Gaza.Mr Biden’s promise raises fundamental questions regarding the delivery of humanitarian aid in a war zone. Political constraints, ethical quandaries and the need to protect the security of aid workers and local communities always make the effort a logistical nightmare.In this specific predicament, US officials have to choose a strategy to deliver the aid without the perception of benefiting Hamas, a group the US and Israel both classify as a terrorist organisation.LogisticsWhen aiding people in war zones, you can’t just send money, a development strategy called “cash transfers” that has become increasingly popular due to its efficiency. Sending money can boost the supply of locally produced goods and services, and help people on the ground pay for what they need most. But injecting cash into an economy so completely cut off from the world would only stoke inflation.So the aid must consist of goods that have to be brought into Gaza, and services provided by people working as part of an aid mission. Humanitarian aid can include food and water; health, sanitation and hygiene supplies and services; and tents and other materials for shelter and settlement.Due to the closure of the border with Israel, aid can arrive in Gaza only via the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border.The US Agency for International Development, or USAid, will likely turn to its long-time partner on the ground, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, to serve as supply depots and distribute goods. That agency, originally founded in 1949 as a temporary measure until a two-state solution could be found, serves in effect as a parallel yet unelected government for Palestinian refugees.USAid will likely want to tap into UNRWA’s network of 284 schools – many of which are now transformed into humanitarian shelters housing two-thirds of the estimated one million people displaced by Israeli air strikes – and 22 hospitals to expedite distribution.PoliticsPrior to the Trump administration, the US was typically the largest single provider of aid to the West Bank and Gaza. USAid administers the lion’s share of it.Since Mr Biden took office, total yearly US assistance for the Palestinian territories has totalled around US$150 million, restored from just US$8 million in 2020 under the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, however, the US was providing more aid to the territories than it is now, with US$1 billion disbursed in the 2013 fiscal year.But the White House needs Congress to approve this assistance – a process that requires the House of Representatives to elect a new Speaker and then for lawmakers to approve aid to Gaza once that happens.EthicsThe UNRWA is a UN organisation. It is not run by Hamas, unlike, for instance, the Gaza Ministry of Health. However, Hamas has frequently undermined UNRWA’s efforts and diverted international aid for military purposes.  Hamas has repeatedly used UNRWA schools as rocket depots. It has repeatedly tunnelled beneath UNRWA schools. It has dismantled European Union-funded water pipes to use as rocket fuselages. And even since the most recent violence broke out, the UNRWA has accused Hamas of stealing fuel and food from its Gaza premises.Humanitarian aid professionals regularly have to contend with these trade-offs when deciding to what extent they can work with governments and local authorities that commit violent acts. They need to do so in exchange for the access required to help civilians under their control.Similarly, Mr Biden has had to make concessions to Israel while brokering for the freedom to send humanitarian aid to Gaza. For example, he has assured Israel that if any of the aid is diverted by Hamas, the operation will cease.This promise may have been politically necessary. But if Mr Biden already believes Hamas to be uncaring about civilian welfare, he may not expect the group to refrain from taking what it can.Security best practicesWhat can be done to protect the security of humanitarian aid operations that take place in the midst of dangerous conflicts?Under international humanitarian law, the local authorities have the primary responsibility for ensuring the delivery of aid – even when they aren’t carrying out that task. To increase the chances that the local authorities will not attack them, aid groups can give “humanitarian notification” and voluntarily alert the local government as to where they will be operating.Hamas has repeatedly flouted international norms and laws. So the question of if and how the aid convoy will be protected looms large.Under the current agreement between the US, Israel and Egypt, the convoy will raise the UN flag. International inspectors will make sure no weapons are on board the vehicles before they cross over from Arish, Egypt, to Rafah, a city located on the Gaza Strip’s border with Egypt.The aid convoy will likely cross without militarised security. This puts it at some danger of diversion once inside Gaza. But whether the aid convoy is attacked, seized or left alone, the Biden administration will have demonstrated its willingness to attempt a humanitarian relief operation. In this sense, a relatively small first convoy bearing water, medical supplies and food, among other items, serves as a test balloon for a sustained operation to follow soon after.If the US were to provide the humanitarian convoy a military escort, by contrast, Hamas could see its presence as a provocation. Washington’s support for Israel is so strong that the US could potentially be judged as a party in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.In that case, the presence of US armed forces might provoke attacks on Gaza-bound aid convoys by Hamas  fighters that otherwise would not have occurred. Combined with the mobilisation of two US Navy carrier groups in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, I’d be concerned that such a move might also stoke regional anger. It would undermine the Biden administration’s attempts to cool the situation.On UN-approved missions, aid delivery may be secured by third-party peacekeepers – meaning, in this case, personnel who are neither Israeli nor Palestinian – with the UN Security Council’s blessing. In this case, tragically, it is unlikely that such a resolution could conceivably pass such a vote, much less quickly enough to make a difference.Topher L.

       "  'Title': 'Scaling up Gaza aid effort faces tangle of challenges',\n",
       "  'Text': 'CAIRO - With a trickle of aid flowing into the besieged Gaza Strip from Egypt, humanitarian staff and diplomats face a web of political, security and logistical obstacles as they try to build up and sustain deliveries of relief.The aid is desperately needed. Supplies of food, water, medicines and fuel have been running critically low for Gaza\\'s 2.3 million people since Israel began its bombardment and \"total siege\" of the Palestinian enclave.Israel’s action is in retaliation for an attack by Hamas militants on Oct 7. But Israel\\'s conditions for inspecting and tracking the aid, security risks transporting and distributing it, and arrangement of its passage through a crossing not used during previous conflicts for large-scale relief efforts have all hampered work to get the operation off the ground.Aid began flowing through Rafah, the main exit and entry point for Gaza that does not border Israel, on Oct 21, with up to 20 trucks crossing daily since. United Nations officials say 100 trucks are required daily to meet essential needs.During past conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, aid had mainly been delivered through crossing points with Israel.The UN aid operation for the Palestinian territories has been run through Israel since the 1950s.Now aid needs to be brought in from Egypt\\'s Sinai Peninsula, an isolated region with a recent history of insurgent attacks and a heavily militarised border. \"It\\'s a huge, huge undertaking to set up a humanitarian operation\\xa0from\\xa0scratch,\" said one aid official who asked not to be named. \"We\\'re not set up like that, not even close, from the\\xa0Egyptian\\xa0side.\"BottlenecksThe aid operation was brokered in talks involving the United States, Israel and Egypt, with a deal to start with a convoy of 20 trucks clinched during a visit by US President Joe Biden to Israel last week, aid officials and diplomats say.As it began, details of an inspection system were still being worked out.Scaling up aid required a quick and light system based on random checks, such as that used for sending aid from Turkey into north-western Syria, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said.Trucks are currently driving more than 40km south along the Egypt-Israel border to be inspected before returning to Gaza.This means a lag of several hours between their entry into the crossing on the Egyptian side and their exit into Gaza. \"There are bottlenecks,\" said Ms Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, which brought some supplies into Gaza with the first convoys but has many more waiting on the Egyptian side of the border.\"What exactly are these bottlenecks? It\\'s very unclear, but I think a lot of it is basically, probably the inspection mechanism and the ability of movement inside Gaza,\" she said.Some Gaza bakeries the WFP works with have been put out of operation because of shortages of fuel, a commodity that has so far not been allowed to cross because of Israeli concerns that it could be used by Hamas.Fuel is also crucial for hospital generators and water supplies, and is fast running out.    US Special Envoy David Satterfield, who has been negotiating with Israel, Egypt and the UN to set up sustained aid deliveries, told MSNBC on Oct 22 that while the critical role of fuel was understood, the provision of food, water and medicine would continue to be the focus \"in the immediate future\".Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.BattlefieldThe US, along with other countries, has also been negotiating to get thousands of foreign passport holders out of Gaza through Rafah.Qatar has meanwhile been leading efforts for the release of hostages taken by Hamas militants during the Oct 7 attack.Two Egyptian security sources linked scaling up of aid to Hamas\\'s willingness to free hostages. From a total of more than 200 hostages, two were freed through Rafah late on Monday, with Hamas crediting Qatar and Egypt for their mediation. Two others were released last week.  The UN says delivery of aid should be unconditional.  On the Gaza side of the border, distribution will depend on the pattern of the conflict and mass displacement of residents, which could be further complicated by an expected Israeli ground operation. As intense bombardment continues, aid organisations have appealed for a humanitarian pause or ceasefire to deliver relief. Security guarantees, especially for northern Gaza where Israeli bombing is concentrated, had not been forthcoming, said Mr Rick Brennan, emergencies director for the World Health Organization. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says 35 of its staff have been killed in Gaza since Oct 7.Bombardment has damaged roads and buildings around Rafah. Not long after Sunday\\'s convoy of trucks entered the crossing, shelling from an Israeli tank hit an Egyptian position nearby, wounding several Egyptian border guards. Israel said the incident was an accident.\"We\\'re going to have to adapt the whole logistics of the operation according to what is transpiring on the battlefield,\" said Mr Griffiths. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Israel PM Netanyahu rejects Gaza ceasefire, says it amounts to ‘surrendering to Hamas’',\n",
       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday a ceasefire in the Israel’s war against Hamas “will not happen”, as the United Nations warned not enough aid was coming in to meet “unprecedented humanitarian needs”.Israeli ground forces fought inside the Gaza Strip and air strikes pounded the besieged Hamas-run Palestinian territory in response to the Oct 7 attack – the deadliest in Israel’s history.The intensifying military operations have sharply heightened fears for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza, where the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says more than 8,300 have been killed.In a briefing to foreign press, Mr Netanyahu said a ceasefire would amount to surrendering to Hamas, whose gunmen killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages, according to the latest Israeli figures.“Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen,” he said, vowing Israel will “fight until this battle is won”.The United States, Israel’s ally, also objected to a ceasefire.“We do not believe that a ceasefire is the right answer right now,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, adding that “pauses” to get aid into Gaza should be considered instead.As Israeli forces battled Hamas militants inside the narrow Palestinian territory and sent tanks to the outskirts of Gaza City, concern has surged about the widening humanitarian crisis.Mr Kirby said Washington was “confident” of increasing the number of aid trucks to Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt to around 100 a day.Limited aid has entered Gaza from Egypt under a US-brokered deal, but its volume has fallen far short of the hundreds of trucks a day aid agencies say are needed.Mr Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, called for the Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs,” he said.Israeli tanks on Gaza highway The Hamas attack set off the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, marked by weeks of withering aerial bombardment and three continuous nights of ground operations centred on northern Gaza, which Israel has told civilians to evacuate.Columns of Israeli tanks and armoured bulldozers were seen churning through the sand, and snipers took positions inside emptied residential buildings, in footage released by the army.Dozens of tanks advanced for more than an hour into the southern fringes of Gaza City and blocked the main north-south highway, “firing at any vehicle that tries to go on it”, an eyewitness told AFP by phone.Air strikes also cratered the road and brought down buildings, residents said, before the tanks withdrew.The Israeli ground forces were supported by heavy fire from the air and artillery, with the army striking more than 600 targets within 24 hours, up from 450 reported by the military a day earlier.Hamas said it had fired anti-tank missiles at two Israeli armoured vehicles and that “blows delivered by the resistance have prevented” Israeli troops from establishing a presence in Gaza.The Israeli military also said a woman soldier was rescued from captivity after an operation in the Hamas-run territory. The release of Ms Ori Megidish was “secured during a ground operation”, the army said, adding that she had been “medically checked” and was “doing well”.Mr Netanyahu said the international community must demand the captives remaining in Gaza “be freed immediately, unconditionally”.Hamas released a video of what it said were three women hostages, seated against a tile wall, although the time and place of the recording could not be verified.One called in an agitated tone for Mr Netanyahu to agree to Hamas’ proposed exchange of the hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Mr Netanyahu decried the clip as “cruel psychological propaganda”.‘Bombing followed us’ The more than 230 hostages – aged between a few months and above 80 – are believed to be held in a network of underground tunnels where Hamas has hid its military infrastructure from Israeli surveillance and air attacks.Israel confirmed the death of one of those missing – German-Israeli Shani Louk, 23, who was captured by Hamas when its gunmen stormed a desert music festival.Fear and desperation have spiralled in Gaza, under weeks of siege that have cut off water, food, fuel and other essentials.Internet access was severed on Friday but restored on Sunday following US pressure, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.“We made clear to the government of Israel over the weekend that communications networks needed to be restored,” he said on Monday. “It is about ensuring that vital information flows, humanitarian coordination continues and families can stay in touch.”The UN reported on Sunday that “thousands of people” had ransacked aid warehouses in Gaza.Donkey carts were lining up to load water, as safe drinking water has become scarce in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.According to the UN, all 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders – despite sheltering thousands of patients and about 117,000 displaced people.“We were displaced from our homes to the hospital,” Gaza City resident Ashraf al-Muzani, 38, said from Al-Quds hospital where he and his family have sheltered for a week. “The bombing followed us,” he added. “We haven’t been able to sleep and our children are so frightened.”‘Highest’ UN death toll Mr Lazzarini said 64 of his colleagues had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, “the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict in such a short time”.Anti-Israel anger has flared across the region and beyond.In Russia’s Muslim-majority Dagestan, police said they had arrested 60 people after a crowd stormed an airport on Sunday to attack passengers arriving from Tel Aviv.And Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the US of being responsible for what he called “deadly chaos” unfolding in the Middle East.Washington has warned Israel’s enemies – in particular Iran-allied groups – not to become more fully involved after a series of attacks across the region. Israel’s military has struck targets in Syria and traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told AFP he was “doing my duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war”.Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank where health officials say about 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire and in settler attacks since the Gaza war started.

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – As part of efforts to help the victims of the conflict in Gaza, the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) will be sending US$200,000 (S$273,000) worth of relief supplies to the war zone.The SRC said on Tuesday that the relief supplies will include items such as hygiene kits, clean water, food provisions, and medical consumables and equipment such as wheelchairs.The SRC has also deployed a staff member to Cairo, Egypt, to work with the Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC) in identifying immediate and critical needs in Gaza, and to facilitate the delivery of relief supplies in the coming days.The SRC and ERC are working closely to coordinate humanitarian aid into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing – the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.They are also scaling up efforts to provide more humanitarian assistance, the SRC said.Food, water and medical supplies have been coming through the Egyptian border, but the provided aid is simply too small to meet the huge needs on the ground, according to reports.Affected communities in the Gaza Strip have received limited humanitarian aid, said the SRC statement, adding that the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has been working under “challenging conditions” to deliver emergency assistance such as ambulance and healthcare services.“There are severe shortages of essential necessities such as fuel, water and food, while medical supplies are depleting rapidly,” said the SRC.“While some humanitarian aid has arrived in Gaza with support from the ERC and PRCS, it remains inadequate to meet the extensive needs.”SRC chief executive Benjamin William said: “We are deeply concerned about the suffering and anguish experienced by the people in Gaza. Families, children, women and the elderly are enduring unimaginable hardships.”Many victims have to walk long distances to reach safe areas and have no access to basic necessities such as shelter and water, he said.He added that damaged infrastructure and a “communication paralysis” have exacerbated the crisis, leaving victims disconnected from the outside world.“We continue to urge all parties involved to uphold their responsibilities as outlined in international humanitarian law, and prioritise the protection of civilians,” said Mr William, adding that it is important for hospitals, doctors, nurses and humanitarian workers to be protected as well.“It is essential that all parties recognise and enable unhindered critical humanitarian aid into Gaza for all the affected communities, including those who have been displaced.” Two weeks ago, the SRC launched a public fund-raising appeal for relief and recovery operations, which will close on Jan 31, 2024.The organisation earlier pledged US$150,000 to relief efforts, while the Singapore Government contributed $300,000 towards relief operations through the SRC.Members of the public who wish to make an online donation can visit redcross.sg/gazaresponse',\n",

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Singapore has expressed its support for the efforts of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to sustain the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and calls for all innocent civilian lives to be protected, said Singapore’s Ambassador to the UN Burhan Gafoor.“At the outset, I wish to express Singapore’s utmost support for the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to sustain the flow of humanitarian assistance to the civilians affected by this terrible tragedy in Gaza,” said Mr Gafoor.“We commend the Secretary-General for his leadership role in facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance and recognise the important contributions made by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations on the ground,” he noted.He added that Singapore supports all efforts to defuse tensions in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict.“Respect for the UN Charter and for international law has always been a fundamental guiding principle of Singapore’s foreign policy. The UN Charter and international law provide the foundation for international peace and security,” Mr Gafoor said.The ambassador made these comments at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, as Singapore voted in support of a resolution drafted by Arab states calling for an immediate humanitarian truce.The non-binding resolution received 121 votes in favour, while 44 abstained and 14 – including Israel and the United States – voted “no”. Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s retaliatory action has killed more than 7,000 people in Gaza, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry. Mr Gafoor said: “We mourn the loss and suffering of so many innocent civilians, including children and the elderly. This attack (by Hamas) cannot be condoned or justified by any rationale. We condemn this terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms. We also call for the immediate and safe release of all hostages taken by Hamas.“In this regard, it is worth recalling that just in June this year, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,” he noted. This, he said, calls for the international community to reiterate its “strong and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes”.Israel has the legitimate right to defend its citizens and its territory under international law, said Mr Gafoor.However, he also pointed out that Israel also has an obligation to comply with international humanitarian law.\\xa0“All parties must abide by international humanitarian law and do their utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians,” said the ambassador.He added that Singapore welcomes all efforts to establish and uphold safe zones and routes that will keep civilians out of harm’s way and allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. “Singapore is deeply saddened by the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the loss of so many civilian lives. This is a massive humanitarian crisis,” said Mr Gafoor.“We urge all parties involved to allow the rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and essential services to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” he added. To support humanitarian relief operations in Gaza, the Government has made a financial contribution through the Singapore Red Cross, said Mr Gafoor. Many Singaporeans have also made their own contributions to relief operations, he said, noting that it is the Republic’s hope that their contributions will reach those in need quickly. On the resolution, Mr Gafoor said that Singapore has voted in favour after very careful consideration, but added that the Republic deeply regrets that this resolution has “two glaring and significant omissions”. “First, it makes no mention of Hamas’ role in perpetrating the massive and coordinated terror attacks, which led to the brutal killing of 1,400 Israelis and others and the abduction of more than 200 hostages,” he said.“These are acts of terror that we condemn unequivocally, and the abhorrent deeds of Hamas cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever,” said the ambassador, as he reiterated Singapore’s call for the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all civilians taken hostage. “Second, this resolution\\xa0does not acknowledge Israel’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory in compliance with international law. As with every country, Israel has a right to defend itself from heinous terrorist attacks, to protect its people from senseless violence and to keep its territory secure,” he added.Nevertheless, Singapore supported the resolution as the Republic has “always been a consistent advocate and defender of international law, the UN Charter and the rules-based multilateral system”, said Mr Gafoor.\\xa0\\xa0He pointed out that the resolution reaffirms all parties’ obligations to respect and uphold international law, including international humanitarian law. “It expresses strong support for the efforts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and for his calls for the immediate and unrestricted access of humanitarian aid, and to respond to the most basic needs of the Palestinian civilian population amidst the unfolding humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip,” said Mr Gafoor.The resolution, he said, demands that all parties immediately and fully comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law.\\xa0“These obligations have been spelt out in many UN Security Council resolutions. All innocent civilian lives must be protected,” he stressed.On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr Gafoor said that it is a “longstanding one, and it must be resolved in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. He called it the only way to stop the repeated cycles of violence. “Singapore’s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been consistent. We continue to hold the view that the only viable path to a durable, just and comprehensive solution is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” he said. Mr Gafoor also stressed that Singapore calls on leaders from both sides to show leadership, to exercise restraint and to take the difficult but necessary steps towards the vision of a two-state solution.“We support the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland, and Israel’s right to live within secure borders. Both Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, security and dignity,” he added.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Aid supplies to Gaza halted again, UN says starvation imminent   ',\n",
       "  'Text': 'GAZA/JERUSALEM – United Nations aid deliveries to Gaza were suspended again on Nov 17 due to shortages of fuel and a communications shutdown, deepening the misery of thousands of hungry and homeless Palestinians as Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the enclave. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said civilians faced the “immediate possibility of starvation” due to the lack of food supplies. Palestinian news agency Wafa said a number of Palestinians were killed and others injured in an Israeli strike that hit a group of displaced people near the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt – the transit point for aid. Al Jazeera TV cited sources as saying that nine people were killed in the strike. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the reported strike, and Reuters could not verify it.In other developments, Israel said its troops had found a tunnel shaft used by Hamas at Al-Shifa Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip.The hospital, packed with patients and displaced people and struggling to keep operating, has been a major focus of global concern this week. Israel says Hamas has stored weapons and ammunition and is holding hostages in a network of tunnels under hospitals like Shifa, using patients and people taking shelter there as human shields. Hamas denies this.With the war about to enter its seventh week, there is no sign of any let-up despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.The conflict was triggered by a cross-border raid by Hamas militants on Oct 7 that killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, in the deadliest day in the state’s 75-year-history.More than 11,500 Palestinians, at least 4,700 of them children, have now been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military assault on Hamas-ruled Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry – a toll that far surpasses previous bouts of conflict in recent years.Israel has vowed to wipe out the militant group. Whole neighbourhoods of Gaza have been flattened in air and artillery strikes, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, and the humanitarian situation is catastrophic, aid agencies say.Trucks suspendedThe UN said there would be no cross-border aid operation on Nov 17 due to fuel shortages and a communication shutdown.  For a second consecutive day on Nov 16, no aid lorries arrived in Gaza due to lack of fuel for distributing relief.WFP executive director Cindy McCain said nearly the entire population was in desperate need of food assistance.“Supplies of food and water are practically non-existent in Gaza and only a fraction of what is needed is arriving through the borders,” she said in a statement.“With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,” Ms McCain said.A UN human rights official said Israel must allow water and fuel into Gaza to restart the water supply network.“Every hour that passes with Israel preventing the provision of safe drinking water in the Gaza Strip, in brazen breach of international law, puts Gazans at risk of dying of thirst and diseases,” Mr Pedro Arrojo-Agudo said.The World Health Organisation on Nov 17 said it was very worried about the spread of disease in Gaza, citing more than 70,000 reported cases of acute respiratory infections and over 44,000 cases of diarrhoea, far more than expected.The Israeli military’s chief of staff said Israel was close to destroying Hamas’ military system in the northern Gaza Strip, and there were signs the army was taking its campaign to other parts of the coastal enclave of 2.3 million people.Israel accused Hamas of preventing people from heading to the south of the Gaza Strip, which the militant group denied.The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of Al-Shifa, Gaza’s biggest hospital.The video, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a deep hole in the ground, littered with and surrounded by concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.The army said its troops also found a vehicle in the hospital containing a large number of weapons.Reuters journalists have been unable to reach anyone inside Al-Shifa Hospital for more than 24 hours.Hamas on Nov 16 said claims by the United States that the group uses Shifa for military purposes were “a repetition of a blatantly false narrative, demonstrated by the weak and ridiculous performances of the occupation army spokesman”. Israeli officials said Hamas held some of the 240 hostages taken by gunmen on Oct 7 in the hospital complex.On Nov 17 the Israeli military said soldiers retrieved the body of a female soldier who had been held captive in a building near Shifa.The military confirmed her death on Nov 14 after Hamas issued a video of her alive, followed by images of what it said was her body after she was killed in an Israeli strike.On Nov 16, troops recovered the body of another woman hostage, also in a building near Shifa.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Hamas’ Al-Quds Brigades said they had engaged Israeli forces for several hours in the city of Jenin overnight into Nov 17, unleashing a “torrent of fire” and laying ambushes with explosives.Israel’s military said warplanes struck militants in Jenin who had opened fire on Israeli soldiers. It said at least five of the militants were killed.At least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the Oct 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The violence there has underscored fears that the territory, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, could spiral out of control in tandem with the conflict in Gaza. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'GENEVA – \\xa0The United Nations’ high commissioner for human rights on Tuesday condemned allegations of mass killings and executions by Palestinian armed groups, as he warned that Israel’s announcement of a “complete siege” of Gaza would exacerbate the “already dire” humanitarian situation in the coast.“All parties must respect international humanitarian law,” Mr Volker Turk said in a statement. “They must immediately cease attacks targeting civilians and attacks expected to cause disproportionate death and injury of civilians or damage to civilian objects.”As Israeli warplanes struck hundreds of sites on Monday, Israel’s defence minister said “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed into Gaza, which is controlled by the militant group Hamas and is under a 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt that heavily restricts access for people and goods. Mr Turk said the ability of medical facilities to treat the growing number of people wounded in Israeli strikes would be harmed by a “full siege”.  “The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,” he said. He added that restrictions on people and goods must be “justified by military necessity” or may amount to collective punishment.The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza warned on Sunday of large shortages of medicine and health equipment, as well as fuel required to keep hospital electrical generators running.Mr Turk also said he was “deeply shocked and appalled by allegations of summary executions of civilians, and, in some instances, horrifying mass killings by members of Palestinian armed groups”. He called on Palestinian armed factions to immediately release Israeli civilians who were taken hostage. About 150 people are believed to have been abducted by Palestinian gunmen in the attacks that began on Saturday.“It is horrific and deeply distressing to see images of those captured by Palestinian armed groups being ill-treated, as well as reports of killings and the desecration of their bodies,” he said. “Civilians must never be used as bargaining chips.”The World Health Organisation (WHO) called on Tuesday for a humanitarian corridor to be established into and out of the Gaza.The WHO had reported 13 attacks on health facilities in Gaza since the weekend, and that the organisation’s medical supplies stored there had already been used up.\\xa0“WHO is calling for an end to the violence… A humanitarian corridor is needed to reach people with critical medical supplies,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told journalists in Geneva.“We need supplies to come in: hospitals cannot run without fuel, without electricity.“The supplies that we have pre-positioned are already running low so we need those supplies to come,” Mr Jasarevic said.The United Nations humanitarian office said nearly 200,000 people, or nearly a tenth of the population, have fled their homes in Gaza since the start of hostilities.

       "  'Text': 'JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON - Israel\\'s war Cabinet has agreed to allow 140,000 litres of fuel into Gaza every two days, after a request from Washington, amid acute shortages that threatened aid deliveries and communications in the besieged strip, Israel and US officials said on Friday.Israel imposed a strict blockade on all goods entering Hamas-controlled Gaza when it launched a military campaign in response to the Palestinian militant group\\'s Oct 7 rampage, in which they killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages.Israel has since agreed to allow in aid trucks after stringent inspections, and a small amount of fuel was allowed in on Wednesday to keep United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) aid delivery trucks moving.An Israeli official who declined to be identified said two trucks a day would be allowed in to meet the UN\\'s needs, but said the amount would give \"minimal\" support for water, sewage and sanitary systems in Gaza to prevent pandemics.A US State Department official, offering more details, said Israel had committed to allowing in 120,000 litres of fuel every 48 hours for UNRWA\\'s trucks and other needs like desalinisation of water, sewage pumping, bakeries and hospitals in the south of Gaza.An additional 20,000 litres every two days would be allowed in to power generators of telecoms company Paltel, which had warned of an imminent blackout of its cellphone network due to lack of fuel. US officials have been pushing Israel to allow fuel in for some time. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken made calls to members of Israel\\'s war Cabinet on Wednesday, and warned that the fuel shortage risked a humanitarian catastrophe among Gaza\\'s 2.3 million residents, the State Department official said. Israeli officials had previously argued that Hamas should release hostages before it eased the pressure on Gaza, the official said, adding that negotiations on the release of hostages continue separate from the move on fuel.    The Israeli official confirmed the decision came after a request from Washington, and said allowing the fuel in gives Israel extra room to maneuver in the international arena so it can continue its campaign to eradicate Hamas in Gaza.
