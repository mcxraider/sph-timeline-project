        "Text":"SINGAPORE \u2013 A 31-year-old paedophile who first targeted pre-teen boys he befriended, then violated even younger relatives in their own homes, was sentenced to 40 years\u2019 jail and 24 strokes of the cane on Monday.The man, who was diagnosed with paedophilic disorder and assessed in a psychiatric report to be \u201ca clear danger to young boys\u201d, had pleaded guilty in the High Court to three charges of rape and four charges of sexual assault by penetration. Another 47 charges, mostly for similar sexual offences, were taken into consideration during sentencing.The offences, which were related to various acts he committed against six victims in all, were described by prosecutors as \u201camong the worst cases of paedophilic sexual abuse\u201d.  In a letter to the court, the man claimed he was a victim of sexual assault in his youth.   But Justice Mavis Chionh said this was not a mitigating factor and, in any event, there was no evidence to support his allegations. The judge said the man was an adult when he committed the offences and was capable of making his own choice. \u201cHis child victims, tragically, did not have any such choice,\u201d she said.From 2012 to 2014, the man sexually assaulted three friends, who were aged 10 to 13 at the time. Between 2014 and 2018, he was in and out of jail for offences such as theft and mischief. From 2019 to 2020, he sexually abused three nephews, who were aged between six and nine at the time. In October 2019, while he was staying at his aunt\u2019s flat, he inappropriately touched one nephew, then nine years old, and performed a sex act on the sleeping boy.In August 2020, the man\u2019s cousin, who delivered parcels for a living, offered the accused a job as his assistant, and invited him to stay with his family in their flat.The cousin had two sons \u2013 an eight-year-old from his previous marriage and a six-year-old from his current marriage.Between August 2020 and September 2020, the accused took the younger boy into the toilet and handed the victim a mobile phone to distract him. As the boy played a game on the phone, he raped the victim.  The man not only violated the two boys separately, but also took the stepbrothers into the toilet to abuse them together, and made them perform sex acts with each other.The sex crimes came to light in October 2020 after the accused\u2019s mother, who was staying at the flat, saw him lying on top of the younger boy.After hearing about this, the boys\u2019 father managed to locate the accused, and drove him to meet other family members. The resulting commotion led a bystander to call the police. The man was arrested on the same day.",

        "combined":"Title: Paedophile who was \u2018clear danger to young boys\u2019 handed 40 years\u2019 jail; Content: SINGAPORE \u2013 A 31-year-old paedophile who first targeted pre-teen boys he befriended, then violated even younger relatives in their own homes, was sentenced to 40 years\u2019 jail and 24 strokes of the cane on Monday.The man, who was diagnosed with paedophilic disorder and assessed in a psychiatric report to be \u201ca clear danger to young boys\u201d, had pleaded guilty in the High Court to three charges of rape and four charges of sexual assault by penetration. Another 47 charges, mostly for similar sexual offences, were taken into consideration during sentencing.The offences, which were related to various acts he committed against six victims in all, were described by prosecutors as \u201camong the worst cases of paedophilic sexual abuse\u201d.  In a letter to the court, the man claimed he was a victim of sexual assault in his youth.   But Justice Mavis Chionh said this was not a mitigating factor and, in any event, there was no evidence to support his allegations. The judge said the man was an adult when he committed the offences and was capable of making his own choice. \u201cHis child victims, tragically, did not have any such choice,\u201d she said.From 2012 to 2014, the man sexually assaulted three friends, who were aged 10 to 13 at the time. Between 2014 and 2018, he was in and out of jail for offences such as theft and mischief. From 2019 to 2020, he sexually abused three nephews, who were aged between six and nine at the time. In October 2019, while he was staying at his aunt\u2019s flat, he inappropriately touched one nephew, then nine years old, and performed a sex act on the sleeping boy.In August 2020, the man\u2019s cousin, who delivered parcels for a living, offered the accused a job as his assistant, and invited him to stay with his family in their flat.The cousin had two sons \u2013 an eight-year-old from his previous marriage and a six-year-old from his current marriage.Between August 2020 and September 2020, the accused took the younger boy into the toilet and handed the victim a mobile phone to distract him. As the boy played a game on the phone, he raped the victim.  The man not only violated the two boys separately, but also took the stepbrothers into the toilet to abuse them together, and made them perform sex acts with each other.The sex crimes came to light in October 2020 after the accused\u2019s mother, who was staying at the flat, saw him lying on top of the younger boy.After hearing about this, the boys\u2019 father managed to locate the accused, and drove him to meet other family members. The resulting commotion led a bystander to call the police. The man was arrested on the same day."

        "Text":"SINGAPORE - He was a lauded student volunteer with a welfare organisation that ran a student care centre for children from low-income or troubled families, but he had a dark secret that stayed hidden during his later career as a teacher. Between 1992 and 1996, he committed sexual acts against three young boys. His offences were not exposed for more than 20 years. On Aug 6, 2019, one of his victims, who was sexually abused when he was between 10 and 12 years old, mustered the courage to come forward after reading a news article about victims of sexual crimes. The police report lodged by this first victim, now 40 years old, eventually led to the disclosure of the accused\u2019s offences against two other victims. The second victim, now 39 years old, was between nine and 12 years old when he was abused, while the third victim, now 36, was between five and eight years old when he was abused. On Nov 27, the perpetrator, who is now 48 years old and suspended from teaching, was sentenced to eight years\u2019 jail after he pleaded guilty to one count of committing an indecent act with a child and two counts of committing unnatural sex, an offence that has been repealed. Eight other similar charges were taken into consideration. Prosecutors told the High Court on Monday that the perpetrator did not reoffend while he was a teacher. He cannot be named under a gag order to protect the identities of the victims. In response to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education (MOE) said the individual has been interdicted from duty since August 2019, and is no longer teaching in any school. \u201cMOE takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to our standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service,\u201d said the spokesperson. The perpetrator was between 17 and 20 years old at the time of the offences. He was tasked with supervising children who were receiving childcare services and after-school programmes at the centre. Between 1993 and 1994, during a private tutoring session, he told the first victim to sit on his lap while the boy was naked from the waist down. He then slapped the victim\u2019s genitalia when the boy gave incorrect answers to his maths questions. On another occasion, after everyone else had left the centre, he took the second victim to the children\u2019s playroom and committed an indecent act with the boy. He started having contact with these two victims outside the centre\u2019s operating hours, but no concerns were raised, as he was trusted by the staff and by the boys\u2019 parents. He continued his sexual assault while he gave the two boys private tuition at the second victim\u2019s home when the child\u2019s parents were not in. On one occasion, he exposed himself to the first victim and forced the boy to perform oral sex on him. Between 1992 and 1995, he performed oral sex on the third victim on three occasions, while giving private tuition to the boy at a medical hall owned by the boy\u2019s mother. He also tried to make the third victim perform sexual acts on him, but the boy successfully pulled his hand away. In mitigation, defence counsel Rai Satish said his client was a relatively immature teenager when the offences were committed, and that he was trying to understand his sexual awakening. He said his client remained crime-free after these offences because he learnt that what he had done was wrong and inappropriate behaviour. The haggard-looking offender also read out a letter, sobbing as he apologised to the victims and to his own family for the hurt he caused them. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tay Jia En said the victims were still scarred after more than 20 years. The prosecutor said the third victim\u2019s relationship with his mother was strained because she did not believe what the accused had done to him, while the first victim suffered confidence issues.

        "combined":"Title: Suspended teacher gets 8 years\u2019 jail for sex acts against boys when he was student volunteer; Content: SINGAPORE - He was a lauded student volunteer with a welfare organisation that ran a student care centre for children from low-income or troubled families, but he had a dark secret that stayed hidden during his later career as a teacher. Between 1992 and 1996, he committed sexual acts against three young boys. His offences were not exposed for more than 20 years. On Aug 6, 2019, one of his victims, who was sexually abused when he was between 10 and 12 years old, mustered the courage to come forward after reading a news article about victims of sexual crimes. The police report lodged by this first victim, now 40 years old, eventually led to the disclosure of the accused\u2019s offences against two other victims. The second victim, now 39 years old, was between nine and 12 years old when he was abused, while the third victim, now 36, was between five and eight years old when he was abused. On Nov 27, the perpetrator, who is now 48 years old and suspended from teaching, was sentenced to eight years\u2019 jail after he pleaded guilty to one count of committing an indecent act with a child and two counts of committing unnatural sex, an offence that has been repealed. Eight other similar charges were taken into consideration. Prosecutors told the High Court on Monday that the perpetrator did not reoffend while he was a teacher. He cannot be named under a gag order to protect the identities of the victims. In response to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education (MOE) said the individual has been interdicted from duty since August 2019, and is no longer teaching in any school. \u201cMOE takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to our standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service,\u201d said the spokesperson. The perpetrator was between 17 and 20 years old at the time of the offences. He was tasked with supervising children who were receiving childcare services and after-school programmes at the centre. Between 1993 and 1994, during a private tutoring session, he told the first victim to sit on his lap while the boy was naked from the waist down. He then slapped the victim\u2019s genitalia when the boy gave incorrect answers to his maths questions. On another occasion, after everyone else had left the centre, he took the second victim to the children\u2019s playroom and committed an indecent act with the boy. He started having contact with these two victims outside the centre\u2019s operating hours, but no concerns were raised, as he was trusted by the staff and by the boys\u2019 parents. He continued his sexual assault while he gave the two boys private tuition at the second victim\u2019s home when the child\u2019s parents were not in. On one occasion, he exposed himself to the first victim and forced the boy to perform oral sex on him. Between 1992 and 1995, he performed oral sex on the third victim on three occasions, while giving private tuition to the boy at a medical hall owned by the boy\u2019s mother. He also tried to make the third victim perform sexual acts on him, but the boy successfully pulled his hand away. In mitigation, defence counsel Rai Satish said his client was a relatively immature teenager when the offences were committed, and that he was trying to understand his sexual awakening. He said his client remained crime-free after these offences because he learnt that what he had done was wrong and inappropriate behaviour. The haggard-looking offender also read out a letter, sobbing as he apologised to the victims and to his own family for the hurt he caused them. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tay Jia En said the victims were still scarred after more than 20 years. The prosecutor said the third victim\u2019s relationship with his mother was strained because she did not believe what the accused had done to him, while the first victim suffered confidence issues."

        "Text":"SINGAPORE - A man who was 18 years old when he took part in the gang rape of two teenage girls was sentenced to 16 years\u2019 jail and 20 strokes of the cane for his role in separate incidents where the victims were plied with alcohol. Muhammad Uzair Abdul Rahman, who is now 20, also sexually assaulted two other victims, in a crime spree that saw him violate at least three young girls in a matter of weeks in 2021.Uzair, who was arrested on June 13 that year, pleaded guilty on Friday to two charges of rape \u2013 one relating to a 16-year-old, and the other to a 14-year-old \u2013 and one charge of sexual penetration of a minor relating to a third victim, aged 14. Another five charges for various sexual offences were taken into consideration during sentencing. They comprised charges of outrage of modesty relating to the 16-year-old, and sexual assault by penetration of a minor under 16 relating to the third victim and a fourth victim.Prosecutors told the High Court that the 16-year-old, who knew she was being passed around but was too intoxicated to fend off her assailants, suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the rape.Uzair\u2019s alleged accomplices \u2013 Noor Asri Mohd Tahil, 36; Mohammad Shahridzmie Salleh, 20; and Umar Abdul Rahim, 20 \u2013 have not been dealt with yet.Uzair\u2019s offences took place in the bedroom of Asri\u2019s one-room flat when the victims were heavily intoxicated. Asri lived alone and would regularly invite large groups of people to hang out for drinks.The 14-year-old rape victim was a runaway who was invited by her friend to hang out at Asri\u2019s place.In May 2021, she was introduced to a group of men, including Uzair and the alleged accomplices, who knew she was 14.At first, she watched as the group drank whisky and beer, but was eventually persuaded to try the alcohol.She then began staying at Asri\u2019s flat. During her stay, various sexual acts were committed on her.On one occasion, under the guise of playing a game of truth or dare, she was made to enter the bedroom with Asri and Uzair. Uzair admitted that he watched as Asri violated the girl.On another occasion that same month, she became very drunk and drifted in and out of consciousness. One of the men carried her to the bedroom and placed her on the bed. Uzair admitted that he and his accomplices took turns to rape her. In June 2021, she was found by the police and placed at the Singapore Girls\u2019 Home, where she told a counsellor that she was raped. Her mother made a police report the following month on July 1.The 16-year-old victim was raped in the early hours of June 13 that year.She was drinking with her friends at Admiralty Park when she met Asri, Uzair and another man for the first time. Asri suggested that they continue drinking at his place.Surveillance footage from the lift lobby of his block showed that she could not stand straight and had to lean on Asri\u2019s e-scooter for support before staggering into the lift. At some point, the victim called a friend to pick her up. While waiting for her friend to arrive, she was pulled into the bedroom. Despite her cries of \u201cI don\u2019t want\u201d, she was sexually assaulted and raped.Deputy Public Prosecutor Shamini Joseph said in sentencing submissions: \u201cShe was unable to defend herself when the accused and the co-accused persons moved her body around like a ragdoll and sexually assaulted her for their sexual gratification.\u201dWhen her friends arrived to pick her up, Asri denied knowing her and shut the door. But the friends continued knocking.They eventually helped her leave the flat, as she could not walk properly.After she told her friends that she was raped, two of her brothers arrived at the block to confront Asri\u2019s group at the void deck. The confrontation turned violent, and a passer-by called the police at about 3.30am.In the course of investigations into the rape, it was revealed that Uzair had also sexually assaulted a third victim.This victim had run away from home in February 2021, and started hanging out with Uzair and his group.Between April and May that year, Uzair made sexual advances towards her, but she rejected him.On the night of May 23, 2021, he sexually assaulted her during a drinking session at Asri\u2019s place.She did not report the incident as she was fearful of her parents\u2019 reaction and because the police were looking for her since she had run away from home.",

        "combined":"Title: 16 years\u2019 jail, caning for man who took part in gang rape of 2 teen girls; Content: SINGAPORE - A man who was 18 years old when he took part in the gang rape of two teenage girls was sentenced to 16 years\u2019 jail and 20 strokes of the cane for his role in separate incidents where the victims were plied with alcohol. Muhammad Uzair Abdul Rahman, who is now 20, also sexually assaulted two other victims, in a crime spree that saw him violate at least three young girls in a matter of weeks in 2021.Uzair, who was arrested on June 13 that year, pleaded guilty on Friday to two charges of rape \u2013 one relating to a 16-year-old, and the other to a 14-year-old \u2013 and one charge of sexual penetration of a minor relating to a third victim, aged 14. Another five charges for various sexual offences were taken into consideration during sentencing. They comprised charges of outrage of modesty relating to the 16-year-old, and sexual assault by penetration of a minor under 16 relating to the third victim and a fourth victim.Prosecutors told the High Court that the 16-year-old, who knew she was being passed around but was too intoxicated to fend off her assailants, suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the rape.Uzair\u2019s alleged accomplices \u2013 Noor Asri Mohd Tahil, 36; Mohammad Shahridzmie Salleh, 20; and Umar Abdul Rahim, 20 \u2013 have not been dealt with yet.Uzair\u2019s offences took place in the bedroom of Asri\u2019s one-room flat when the victims were heavily intoxicated. Asri lived alone and would regularly invite large groups of people to hang out for drinks.The 14-year-old rape victim was a runaway who was invited by her friend to hang out at Asri\u2019s place.In May 2021, she was introduced to a group of men, including Uzair and the alleged accomplices, who knew she was 14.At first, she watched as the group drank whisky and beer, but was eventually persuaded to try the alcohol.She then began staying at Asri\u2019s flat. During her stay, various sexual acts were committed on her.On one occasion, under the guise of playing a game of truth or dare, she was made to enter the bedroom with Asri and Uzair. Uzair admitted that he watched as Asri violated the girl.On another occasion that same month, she became very drunk and drifted in and out of consciousness. One of the men carried her to the bedroom and placed her on the bed. Uzair admitted that he and his accomplices took turns to rape her. In June 2021, she was found by the police and placed at the Singapore Girls\u2019 Home, where she told a counsellor that she was raped. Her mother made a police report the following month on July 1.The 16-year-old victim was raped in the early hours of June 13 that year.She was drinking with her friends at Admiralty Park when she met Asri, Uzair and another man for the first time. Asri suggested that they continue drinking at his place.Surveillance footage from the lift lobby of his block showed that she could not stand straight and had to lean on Asri\u2019s e-scooter for support before staggering into the lift. At some point, the victim called a friend to pick her up. While waiting for her friend to arrive, she was pulled into the bedroom. Despite her cries of \u201cI don\u2019t want\u201d, she was sexually assaulted and raped.Deputy Public Prosecutor Shamini Joseph said in sentencing submissions: \u201cShe was unable to defend herself when the accused and the co-accused persons moved her body around like a ragdoll and sexually assaulted her for their sexual gratification.\u201dWhen her friends arrived to pick her up, Asri denied knowing her and shut the door. But the friends continued knocking.They eventually helped her leave the flat, as she could not walk properly.After she told her friends that she was raped, two of her brothers arrived at the block to confront Asri\u2019s group at the void deck. The confrontation turned violent, and a passer-by called the police at about 3.30am.In the course of investigations into the rape, it was revealed that Uzair had also sexually assaulted a third victim.This victim had run away from home in February 2021, and started hanging out with Uzair and his group.Between April and May that year, Uzair made sexual advances towards her, but she rejected him.On the night of May 23, 2021, he sexually assaulted her during a drinking session at Asri\u2019s place.She did not report the incident as she was fearful of her parents\u2019 reaction and because the police were looking for her since she had run away from home."

        "Text":"LOS ANGELES \u2013 Actor Ashton Kutcher has stepped down as chair of Thorn, an organisation he co-founded to combat child sexual abuse, after he and his wife, actress Mila Kunis, drew criticism for writing letters to a judge seeking leniency in the sentencing of their That \u201970s Show co-star Danny Masterson, who was recently sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for rape. The couple\u2019s support of Masterson started a firestorm that prompted them to respond in an Instagram video last weekend.  Kutcher announced he had resigned from Thorn in a letter to its board dated Aug 14 and posted on the organisation\u2019s website.\u201cI have determined the responsible thing for me to do is resign as chairman of the board, effectively immediately,\u201d Kutcher wrote. \u201cI cannot allow my error in judgment to distract from our efforts and the children we serve.\u201dIn May, Masterson, 47, was found guilty in a Los Angeles court of raping two women in the early 2000s, at the height of his career. A judge last week sentenced him to the maximum penalty, 30 years to life. He will be eligible for parole in 20 years, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201cVictims of sexual abuse have been historically silenced, and the character statement I submitted is yet another painful instance of questioning victims who are brave enough to share their experiences,\u201d Kutcher wrote in his letter to Thorn. \u201cThis is precisely what we have all worked to reverse over the last decade.\u201dThorn is a non-profit co-founded in 2009 by Kutcher and actress Demi Moore. The organisation has developed technology to help identify victims of child sex abuse online, according to its website.The representatives of Kutcher and Kunis could not be reached on Friday evening, and a request for comment to Thorn was not immediately returned.\u201cWe would not be the Thorn that we are today without Ashton\u2019s contributions,\u201d the organisation said in a statement posted to its website. \u201cHe has played a significant role in the impact we have made, and we are grateful for his participation over the last 15 years.\u201dThe public outcry against Kutcher and Kunis began last week after their letters to the judge in Masterson\u2019s case, Judge Charlaine Olmedo of Los Angeles Superior Court, were published on Substack by journalists who had covered the trial.The letters detailed the couple\u2019s relationship with Masterson.Kutcher, 45; Kunis, 40; and Masterson, 47, were long-time co-stars on the hit sitcom That \u201970s Show, which aired for eight seasons from 1998 to 2006.In a letter dated on July 27, Kutcher told the judge that he did not believe Masterson \u201cis an ongoing harm to society\u201d and called the prospect of Masterson\u2019s daughter being raised without her father a \u201ctertiary injustice in and of itself\u201d.Kunis vouched in her own letter to the judge for Masterson\u2019s character and the \u201ctremendous positive influence he has had on me and the people around him\u201d.In a video posted to Instagram on Sept 9, the couple explained that Masterson\u2019s family had asked them to write the letters \u201cto represent the person that we knew for 25 years so that the judge could take that into full consideration relative to the sentencing\u201d.\u201cThey were intended for the judge to read, and not to undermine the testimony of the victims or re-traumatise them in any way,\u201d Kutcher said in the video.In the letters, Masterson was described as an \u201cexceptional older brother figure\u201d by Kunis, and as \u201camong few people that I would trust to be alone with my son and daughter\u201d by Kutcher.In his resignation letter, Kutcher apologised to victims of sexual violence and members of Thorn \u201cwho I hurt by what I did\u201d.

        "combined":"Title: Ashton Kutcher resigns from anti-child sex abuse non-profit over Danny Masterson letter; Content: LOS ANGELES \u2013 Actor Ashton Kutcher has stepped down as chair of Thorn, an organisation he co-founded to combat child sexual abuse, after he and his wife, actress Mila Kunis, drew criticism for writing letters to a judge seeking leniency in the sentencing of their That \u201970s Show co-star Danny Masterson, who was recently sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for rape. The couple\u2019s support of Masterson started a firestorm that prompted them to respond in an Instagram video last weekend.  Kutcher announced he had resigned from Thorn in a letter to its board dated Aug 14 and posted on the organisation\u2019s website.\u201cI have determined the responsible thing for me to do is resign as chairman of the board, effectively immediately,\u201d Kutcher wrote. \u201cI cannot allow my error in judgment to distract from our efforts and the children we serve.\u201dIn May, Masterson, 47, was found guilty in a Los Angeles court of raping two women in the early 2000s, at the height of his career. A judge last week sentenced him to the maximum penalty, 30 years to life. He will be eligible for parole in 20 years, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201cVictims of sexual abuse have been historically silenced, and the character statement I submitted is yet another painful instance of questioning victims who are brave enough to share their experiences,\u201d Kutcher wrote in his letter to Thorn. \u201cThis is precisely what we have all worked to reverse over the last decade.\u201dThorn is a non-profit co-founded in 2009 by Kutcher and actress Demi Moore. The organisation has developed technology to help identify victims of child sex abuse online, according to its website.The representatives of Kutcher and Kunis could not be reached on Friday evening, and a request for comment to Thorn was not immediately returned.\u201cWe would not be the Thorn that we are today without Ashton\u2019s contributions,\u201d the organisation said in a statement posted to its website. \u201cHe has played a significant role in the impact we have made, and we are grateful for his participation over the last 15 years.\u201dThe public outcry against Kutcher and Kunis began last week after their letters to the judge in Masterson\u2019s case, Judge Charlaine Olmedo of Los Angeles Superior Court, were published on Substack by journalists who had covered the trial.The letters detailed the couple\u2019s relationship with Masterson.Kutcher, 45; Kunis, 40; and Masterson, 47, were long-time co-stars on the hit sitcom That \u201970s Show, which aired for eight seasons from 1998 to 2006.In a letter dated on July 27, Kutcher told the judge that he did not believe Masterson \u201cis an ongoing harm to society\u201d and called the prospect of Masterson\u2019s daughter being raised without her father a \u201ctertiary injustice in and of itself\u201d.Kunis vouched in her own letter to the judge for Masterson\u2019s character and the \u201ctremendous positive influence he has had on me and the people around him\u201d.In a video posted to Instagram on Sept 9, the couple explained that Masterson\u2019s family had asked them to write the letters \u201cto represent the person that we knew for 25 years so that the judge could take that into full consideration relative to the sentencing\u201d.\u201cThey were intended for the judge to read, and not to undermine the testimony of the victims or re-traumatise them in any way,\u201d Kutcher said in the video.In the letters, Masterson was described as an \u201cexceptional older brother figure\u201d by Kunis, and as \u201camong few people that I would trust to be alone with my son and daughter\u201d by Kutcher.In his resignation letter, Kutcher apologised to victims of sexual violence and members of Thorn \u201cwho I hurt by what I did\u201d.

        "Text":"SINGAPORE - Eve (not her real name) was relentlessly spammed on social media with profane messages from an unknown sender,\u00a0as part of a vendetta against her by a woman jealous of her for seeing a man. It started in April 2022 with a handful of private messages in Tellonym, a question-and-answer style social media app. Within days, it grew to dozens of messages a day, leading Eve to believe she was being personally targeted. \u201cThe harasser seemed to know my daily plans and where I was going. She even knew that I had lost my grandfather lately and mocked me about it,\u201d Eve, who works in finance, told The Straits Times. \u201cThe messages were non-stop. It\u2019s like she made it her only goal in life to disturb me.\u201d The online abuse became worse over time. But she did not block the harasser to collect evidence.In May 2022, the stranger took matters into the public sphere, creating fake social media accounts with the word \u201cwhore\u201d plastered over a profile picture Eve used then. The stranger also took to the comments section of a public LinkedIn post linked to her company to accuse Eve of infidelity and curse her family in clear view of several hundreds of colleagues and account followers. It was the tipping point for Eve, who lost sleep over concerns that her reputation at work would be affected by the rumours she did not dare to address online.She made a police report in person, hoping to put a stop to the abuse. She said that the authorities informed her that the woman had received an official warning, roughly a month after the incident was reported.Eve thought the matter was behind her. But in July, she received a prank call believed to be from her harasser. The caller only said \u201chello\u201d after a long pause, but Eve traced the contact to a woman who knew the man she was seeing then.\u201cI thought I could put it to rest but the call made me think this woman is still out there to disturb me even after I reported her,\u201d said Eve. \u201cIt just showed it did not work to stop her.\u201d The police said it issued a warning to a 31-year-old woman on Oct 17, 2023, in consultation with the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers, over the offences of unlawful stalking, intentional harassment and unauthorised access to a computer. Her story is not unique. Abuse is common in cyberspace.\u00a0Three in five encountered the likes of cyber bullying and sexual harassment, and many of them described the impact as severe leading to suicidal thoughts, according to a survey by SG Her Empowerment (SHE), a non-profit organisation that focuses on issues affecting women here.The study of more than 1,000 Singapore citizens conducted between May and June this year found that 14 per cent of respondents had personally experienced sexual harassment online before, while two in five victims of online harms faced serious emotional or physical impact, like fearing for their safety, depression and self-harm.\u00a0Younger people were more likely to encounter online harms too, with more than half of respondents who reported a personal experience of such incidents ranging in age from 15 to 24. The spread of harmful online content is backed by a separate survey published in October by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI), which found that two-thirds of Singapore netizens encountered harmful content, but nearly half did not block the offenders or report it to the hosting platform. At a three-day Online Harms Symposium here in September, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said: \u201cWe can\u2019t have generations of young people growing up with these issues. Their mental health, among other things, will be seriously affected.\u201d Mr Shanmugam also urged the hundreds of industry players at the event on Sept 25 to explore new ways to protect victims. \u201cThe question is, are we doing enough to protect victims and should we change our laws? How can we empower them and what remedies are appropriate?\u201d he said at the symposium.   Laws here have evolved to tackle the rise of online harms in recent years.\u00a0In 2019, the Penal Code was amended to dish out heavier punishment for those who share or threaten to distribute intimate images, and other tech-enabled sexual offences. The Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) was also tweaked in 2019 to tackle doxxing \u2013 publishing details about a victim to harass or threaten them \u2013 and allow victims to head to court to seek a correction order.The changes followed feedback that such recourse should be simplified to combat a trend of netizens consolidating an individual\u2019s personal information to be published online. But the onus still lies on the victim to gather evidence against a perpetrator \u2013 who may be anonymous \u2013 to seek claims. In 2022, the Broadcasting Act was amended to include a new Online Safety Act to compel major social media platforms to take down egregious content including those that promote violence and terrorism; dangerous viral challenges; sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment; threats to public health; and threats to racial and religious harmony.\u00a0But the law does not specify a takedown timeframe.Passed in 2023, the Online Criminal Harms Act does similar for scams and malicious cyber activities, allowing the authorities to tell individuals and businesses to remove or block access to content it suspects is being used for crime. Orders can apply to platforms like Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp and WeChat and are aimed at curbing criminal harms, like drug-related offences, illegal moneylending and scams. Expanding definitionsWhile recently passed laws tackle the most severe harms online, they do not specifically address non-criminal actions that still cause distress.  For instance, gossip, public shaming or cyber bullying may slip through the cracks but have a long-term effect on victims. They also do not specifically address victims of image-based sexual abuse sent via private messaging. Take cyber bullying. Many cases apply to children who do not face the full brunt of the law and many cases do not meet legal standards of harassment, said Singapore Management University (SMU) law professor Eugene Tan.Legal tools are not usually the best fit for young offenders, as it is more important to educate them while providing guidance to both parties, he said.\u00a0Cyber bullying can take many forms, like sending hurtful messages, gossiping about someone online, or sharing embarrassing content of a person, said Institute of Policy Studies principal research fellow Carol Soon, who is also vice-chair of the Media Literacy Council, which looks at online harms.  But mechanisms to report online abuse often take too long. Victims feel that it is too difficult to prove their case, she added. Judicial Commissioner Goh Yihan said at the symposium that existing causes of action and harassment laws may have limitations when it comes to online harms. For instance, some cases require a claimant to have suffered a recognised psychiatric illness as a result of the abuse. This is not always the case with online harms, but a victim can still be caused embarrassment and distress that is serious, said JC Goh. POHA might not apply if someone takes personal photos of a victim once for their personal gratification with no intention to share it, he said, adding that such actions can still cause distress to the victim who may fear the material may be leaked. It will be better to have focused legislation on online harms and any civil recourse for victims should be swift and simple, he said.\u00a0Speed\u00a0of take-downVictims and experts agree that there needs to be a framework that allows for the quick removal of online posts.SHE\u2019s survey found that more than eight in 10 respondents wanted to see measures that would involve the swift and permanent removal of harms flagged. Most wanted to do so without involving legal action. Respondents in MCI\u2019s survey similarly said that platforms took too long to act and neglected to update them after their reports.For Eve, the trauma was long-drawn. Even after reporting her harasser\u2019s defamatory comments on Facebook to the tech firm, Facebook took up to a week to take down the post.\u00a0LinkedIn took down the comments and impersonated account within an hour of Eve reporting the problem.\u201cOne week is just too long, I couldn\u2019t sleep in peace,\u201d said Eve. \u201cI don\u2019t know who saw it and I don\u2019t dare to ask\u2026 It could damage my professional image too, anyone who didn\u2019t know me well could have misunderstood, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it.\u201d\u00a0Social media platforms have taken anywhere from a day to weeks to respond to cases of online harms flagged by SHE, said lawyer and SHE chief executive Simran Toor.\u00a0Telegram in particular, Ms Toor added, has been notorious as a \u201cdark web\u201d of messaging apps, due to difficulties reaching its administrators and features that allow users to operate anonymously, making it tricky to hold bad actors accountable. The platform is rife with drug-trafficking activities and the sharing of intimate videos without consent.In the case of image-based abuse reported, she suggested a legal presumption that intimate images shared online are shared without consent unless proven otherwise. This would shift the burden of proof to the sharer and ensure prompt removal of flagged content, relieving victims of the time-consuming and draining task of evidence-gathering to show they did not consent to the use of the material this way.\u00a0It will also deter users from unthinkingly sharing such content, for example by forwarding it, Ms Toor added. Much of the burden of proof lies on the victim today, she said. Victims typically require screenshots of the incident, timestamps of when it occurred and the usernames of their harassers.\u00a0\u201cNot everyone gets the evidence they need. Some disconnect from social media, or block the contact before they can get the screenshots required, and now they don\u2019t know how to get it,\u201d said Ms Toor. \u00a0Some victims become discouraged as seeking legal recourse can take time, money and energy, she added. Victims who come to SHE\u2019s online harms support centre SheCares@SCWO for legal advice can face delays if their evidence is not gathered.\u201cWhen cases are reported, it should be assumed as default that the user does not have permission to post such images,\u201d she said, adding that the image should be removed and the sharer face a penalty. \u201cIt can be hard to enforce in viral cases, but at least it gets people thinking before they post something that can make it go viral.\u201d\u00a0Independent watchdogSingapore\u2019s patchwork of laws enforced by the different authorities currently do not fully meet the urgent needs of victims. Thus, experts said there is a need for a dedicated, independent watchdog to be formed to police the variety of harms online and focus on helping victims seek redress. Ms Toor said Australia\u2019s watchdog eSafety could be a good reference, referring to its regime as \u201cthe gold standard\u201d.eSafety was granted powers in 2022 to direct social media firms in Australia to remove flagged harmful content within 24 hours or face penalties.\u00a0It acts on reports of serious online abuse when content on the Internet is likely to harm the physical or mental health of the person targeted.\u00a0 Citizens can report cases including the cyber bullying of young people and children, adult cyber abuse through menacing or harassing messages, and image-based abuse like the spreading of intimate content without consent. It will also investigate material linked to sexual exploitation, pro-terrorism and those that promote crime. eSafety can also order online platforms to hand over user information and contact details, like IP addresses, e-mails, names and phone numbers for investigation. Corporations that do not comply face up to A$156,500 (S$136,000) in fines.\u00a0It is also responsible for public education and coordinating online safety with other countries as the Internet is global, said eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant in an interview with ST in September. She said: \u201cThe business models of many of these social media sites don\u2019t lend themselves to wanting to tackle (online harms) because engagement and conflict sells. If they start removing fake and imposter accounts en masse, that affects their daily and monthly active user numbers, which attract advertisers.\u201dThe watchdog will tighten the leash on tech companies if needed. eSafety famously issued a legal notice in June to X, formerly known as Twitter, to demand an explanation of what the social media giant is doing to combat a surge in online hate speech since billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition. It threatened to fine the company up to A$700,000 for every day of delay if X does not respond with factual and truthful information within 28 days. The move has since forced a response from X, and eSafety is thinking about publishing a summary of that response.Ms Inman Grant said: \u201cI have specific powers to name and shame, but I try to be fair and use due process and this is what the transparency powers does\u2026 It lets me lift the hood of these tech companies and see what companies are actually doing.\u201d\u00a0In September, the watchdog also openly criticised Apple for halting the development of tools to scan for child abuse material before they are uploaded to its iCloud service on its devices due to privacy concerns. Instead, Apple chose to use prompts to warn children about sending or receiving explicit images. Meanwhile, Meta, Microsoft and Google provide these tools. Even so, Ms Inman Grant said there is a delicate dance that has to happen when calling out companies. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in a permanent state of conflict with platforms because part of the work that I do is remediating online harms in real time when our citizens are abused.\u201d Experts said a single agency to address online harm makes it clear for victims to know where they can get help. Dr Soon said victims often want a single port of call given the stress and trauma they face. \u201cThe ability to get in touch with an authority that is not faceless and who can act on the victim\u2019s behalf will bring some relief and comfort to the victim as action is being taken,\u201d she said. Prof Tan said such an agency needs sufficient enforcement levers such as those that eSafety possesses to deal with complaints fast and require platforms to \u201cdisgorge\u201d the identities of perpetrators. He added: \u201cMy own reading is that the authorities are looking at the Australian experience closely, and I won\u2019t be surprised if we have a similar model adapted to the local context.\u201dBritish MP Damian Collins, who chaired a Joint Committee on the United Kingdom\u2019s draft Online Safety Bill passed in September said that having a dedicated regulatory body will go a long way in making the Internet a healthier environment by ensuring swift action against extreme or illegal content, such as those related to self-harm or inciting violence. Hidden in the shadowsEve was kept in the dark about the identity of the woman who harassed her, even after the woman was given an official warning. \u201cI felt very defenceless not knowing who she was then,\u201d said Eve. \u201cShe is still out there. She can walk past me at any time and I wouldn\u2019t even recognise her.\u201d \u201cPeople online tend to think that posting whatever they want is not a big deal. They wouldn\u2019t speak like how they would in real life.\u201d Experts pointed to anonymity as the fuel for online abuse, suggesting that removing the veil would help quicken resolution for victims.With no clue of the perpetrator\u2019s identity at the time and who might have seen the posts, Eve said it was difficult to trust others then. Time is critical for those in even more embarrassing situations, she added.\u00a0SMU\u2019s Prof Tan said that a huge step to curb online harms is to have social media companies require some personal identification information during registration, which must be surrendered to the authorities in the event of online abuse.Doing so has to be a policy from the authorities, as some platforms might prefer not to hold on to users\u2019 identifiable details so that they are not responsible for their posts, said Prof Tan. \u201cIt can be a phone number, or even something temporary, as long as it is traceable,\u201d he suggested. \u201cIf there is some common standard among platforms, it will signal to potential offenders that you can be traced and that anonymity is just a veil.\u201d\u00a0In Australia, eSafety is granted information-gathering powers to order Internet platforms to hand over user information and contact details for investigations. Its spokesman said: \u201cBy identifying these end-users, eSafety can then issue them with legal notices to remove the material and, in some cases, refrain from posting more abusive material.\u201dLooking to the futureThe authorities worldwide are gearing up to rein in artificial intelligence (AI), which if uncontrolled, can complicate online harms further.\u00a0In September, naked images generated by AI of local young girls in the Spanish town of Almendralejo that spread online without the victims\u2019 knowledge shook the world into realising that AI had arrived to complicate online harms further.\u00a0The pictures were created using photos of the targeted girls fully clothed and processed by an app that generates an imagined image of the person without clothes.More than 20 girls have come forward as victims and at least 11 local boys were identified to be involved in creating or spreading the pictures on WhatsApp and Telegram, BBC reported.But it is not clear if the group\u2019s alleged actions constitute a crime as the Spanish authorities investigate the matter.\u00a0Meanwhile, the United States\u2019 Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in June that criminals were increasingly using AI to create sexually explicit images to threaten victims and similar cases have popped up in other parts of Spain. AI-generated abuse is among threats on the horizon that eSafety is keeping tabs on, said Ms Inman Grant. Generative AI can be helpful in content moderation and scanning for harmful material, but it is also used to create child sexual abuse content, she said.\u00a0The commission works with tech companies to promote safety by design \u2013 a practice of anticipating online harms before they occur, instead of retrofitting them after an issue has surfaced, she said.\u00a0Ms Inman Grant said: \u201cWhat if these companies utilise (these tools) to prevent the mass creation of fake accounts? They should be using AI tools to detect words that might be offensive to prevent them from reaching their intended target.\u201dSingapore has similarly adopted a collaborative approach and in June banded with at least 60 global industry players to tackle pressing issues in AI, including deepfakes. The alliance includes the likes of Google, Meta and Microsoft, and according to a report by the Infocomm Media Development Authority, will seek solutions for remedial action if harmful content is generated.  For Eve, it took months to overcome the feeling of paranoia, afraid that her harasser was stalking her. She urged other victims to seek help, such as through support centres like SheCares@SCWO, which provided her with counselling and offered legal advice. \u201cDon\u2019t suffer in silence, because it will only add on to the mental stress,\u201d said Eve. She said clearer laws and instructions on how victims can seek recourse will go a long way to helping them to deal with online harms. \u201cI\u2019m not trained in law, so when I was going through all this, I had to learn how I am protected and what my rights are. I was scanning through as many articles as I could find online, but I wasn\u2019t sure which were still relevant,\u201d said Eve. \u201cThis is something that we can surely look at.\u201d Additional reporting by Zhaki Abdullah Correction note: This article has been updated to reflect Dr Carol Soon\u2019s and Ms Simran Toor\u2019s correct job designations.

        "combined":"Title: Call to let victims seek quicker redress for more types of online harms; Content: SINGAPORE - Eve (not her real name) was relentlessly spammed on social media with profane messages from an unknown sender,\u00a0as part of a vendetta against her by a woman jealous of her for seeing a man. It started in April 2022 with a handful of private messages in Tellonym, a question-and-answer style social media app. Within days, it grew to dozens of messages a day, leading Eve to believe she was being personally targeted. \u201cThe harasser seemed to know my daily plans and where I was going. She even knew that I had lost my grandfather lately and mocked me about it,\u201d Eve, who works in finance, told The Straits Times. \u201cThe messages were non-stop. It\u2019s like she made it her only goal in life to disturb me.\u201d The online abuse became worse over time. But she did not block the harasser to collect evidence.In May 2022, the stranger took matters into the public sphere, creating fake social media accounts with the word \u201cwhore\u201d plastered over a profile picture Eve used then. The stranger also took to the comments section of a public LinkedIn post linked to her company to accuse Eve of infidelity and curse her family in clear view of several hundreds of colleagues and account followers. It was the tipping point for Eve, who lost sleep over concerns that her reputation at work would be affected by the rumours she did not dare to address online.She made a police report in person, hoping to put a stop to the abuse. She said that the authorities informed her that the woman had received an official warning, roughly a month after the incident was reported.Eve thought the matter was behind her. But in July, she received a prank call believed to be from her harasser. The caller only said \u201chello\u201d after a long pause, but Eve traced the contact to a woman who knew the man she was seeing then.\u201cI thought I could put it to rest but the call made me think this woman is still out there to disturb me even after I reported her,\u201d said Eve. \u201cIt just showed it did not work to stop her.\u201d The police said it issued a warning to a 31-year-old woman on Oct 17, 2023, in consultation with the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers, over the offences of unlawful stalking, intentional harassment and unauthorised access to a computer. Her story is not unique. Abuse is common in cyberspace.\u00a0Three in five encountered the likes of cyber bullying and sexual harassment, and many of them described the impact as severe leading to suicidal thoughts, according to a survey by SG Her Empowerment (SHE), a non-profit organisation that focuses on issues affecting women here.The study of more than 1,000 Singapore citizens conducted between May and June this year found that 14 per cent of respondents had personally experienced sexual harassment online before, while two in five victims of online harms faced serious emotional or physical impact, like fearing for their safety, depression and self-harm.\u00a0Younger people were more likely to encounter online harms too, with more than half of respondents who reported a personal experience of such incidents ranging in age from 15 to 24. The spread of harmful online content is backed by a separate survey published in October by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI), which found that two-thirds of Singapore netizens encountered harmful content, but nearly half did not block the offenders or report it to the hosting platform. At a three-day Online Harms Symposium here in September, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said: \u201cWe can\u2019t have generations of young people growing up with these issues. Their mental health, among other things, will be seriously affected.\u201d Mr Shanmugam also urged the hundreds of industry players at the event on Sept 25 to explore new ways to protect victims. \u201cThe question is, are we doing enough to protect victims and should we change our laws? How can we empower them and what remedies are appropriate?\u201d he said at the symposium.   Laws here have evolved to tackle the rise of online harms in recent years.\u00a0In 2019, the Penal Code was amended to dish out heavier punishment for those who share or threaten to distribute intimate images, and other tech-enabled sexual offences. The Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) was also tweaked in 2019 to tackle doxxing \u2013 publishing details about a victim to harass or threaten them \u2013 and allow victims to head to court to seek a correction order.The changes followed feedback that such recourse should be simplified to combat a trend of netizens consolidating an individual\u2019s personal information to be published online. But the onus still lies on the victim to gather evidence against a perpetrator \u2013 who may be anonymous \u2013 to seek claims. In 2022, the Broadcasting Act was amended to include a new Online Safety Act to compel major social media platforms to take down egregious content including those that promote violence and terrorism; dangerous viral challenges; sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment; threats to public health; and threats to racial and religious harmony.\u00a0But the law does not specify a takedown timeframe.Passed in 2023, the Online Criminal Harms Act does similar for scams and malicious cyber activities, allowing the authorities to tell individuals and businesses to remove or block access to content it suspects is being used for crime. Orders can apply to platforms like Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp and WeChat and are aimed at curbing criminal harms, like drug-related offences, illegal moneylending and scams. Expanding definitionsWhile recently passed laws tackle the most severe harms online, they do not specifically address non-criminal actions that still cause distress.  For instance, gossip, public shaming or cyber bullying may slip through the cracks but have a long-term effect on victims. They also do not specifically address victims of image-based sexual abuse sent via private messaging. Take cyber bullying. Many cases apply to children who do not face the full brunt of the law and many cases do not meet legal standards of harassment, said Singapore Management University (SMU) law professor Eugene Tan.Legal tools are not usually the best fit for young offenders, as it is more important to educate them while providing guidance to both parties, he said.\u00a0Cyber bullying can take many forms, like sending hurtful messages, gossiping about someone online, or sharing embarrassing content of a person, said Institute of Policy Studies principal research fellow Carol Soon, who is also vice-chair of the Media Literacy Council, which looks at online harms.  But mechanisms to report online abuse often take too long. Victims feel that it is too difficult to prove their case, she added. Judicial Commissioner Goh Yihan said at the symposium that existing causes of action and harassment laws may have limitations when it comes to online harms. For instance, some cases require a claimant to have suffered a recognised psychiatric illness as a result of the abuse. This is not always the case with online harms, but a victim can still be caused embarrassment and distress that is serious, said JC Goh. POHA might not apply if someone takes personal photos of a victim once for their personal gratification with no intention to share it, he said, adding that such actions can still cause distress to the victim who may fear the material may be leaked. It will be better to have focused legislation on online harms and any civil recourse for victims should be swift and simple, he said.\u00a0Speed\u00a0of take-downVictims and experts agree that there needs to be a framework that allows for the quick removal of online posts.SHE\u2019s survey found that more than eight in 10 respondents wanted to see measures that would involve the swift and permanent removal of harms flagged. Most wanted to do so without involving legal action. Respondents in MCI\u2019s survey similarly said that platforms took too long to act and neglected to update them after their reports.For Eve, the trauma was long-drawn. Even after reporting her harasser\u2019s defamatory comments on Facebook to the tech firm, Facebook took up to a week to take down the post.\u00a0LinkedIn took down the comments and impersonated account within an hour of Eve reporting the problem.\u201cOne week is just too long, I couldn\u2019t sleep in peace,\u201d said Eve. \u201cI don\u2019t know who saw it and I don\u2019t dare to ask\u2026 It could damage my professional image too, anyone who didn\u2019t know me well could have misunderstood, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it.\u201d\u00a0Social media platforms have taken anywhere from a day to weeks to respond to cases of online harms flagged by SHE, said lawyer and SHE chief executive Simran Toor.\u00a0Telegram in particular, Ms Toor added, has been notorious as a \u201cdark web\u201d of messaging apps, due to difficulties reaching its administrators and features that allow users to operate anonymously, making it tricky to hold bad actors accountable. The platform is rife with drug-trafficking activities and the sharing of intimate videos without consent.In the case of image-based abuse reported, she suggested a legal presumption that intimate images shared online are shared without consent unless proven otherwise. This would shift the burden of proof to the sharer and ensure prompt removal of flagged content, relieving victims of the time-consuming and draining task of evidence-gathering to show they did not consent to the use of the material this way.\u00a0It will also deter users from unthinkingly sharing such content, for example by forwarding it, Ms Toor added. Much of the burden of proof lies on the victim today, she said. Victims typically require screenshots of the incident, timestamps of when it occurred and the usernames of their harassers.\u00a0\u201cNot everyone gets the evidence they need. Some disconnect from social media, or block the contact before they can get the screenshots required, and now they don\u2019t know how to get it,\u201d said Ms Toor. \u00a0Some victims become discouraged as seeking legal recourse can take time, money and energy, she added. Victims who come to SHE\u2019s online harms support centre SheCares@SCWO for legal advice can face delays if their evidence is not gathered.\u201cWhen cases are reported, it should be assumed as default that the user does not have permission to post such images,\u201d she said, adding that the image should be removed and the sharer face a penalty. \u201cIt can be hard to enforce in viral cases, but at least it gets people thinking before they post something that can make it go viral.\u201d\u00a0Independent watchdogSingapore\u2019s patchwork of laws enforced by the different authorities currently do not fully meet the urgent needs of victims. Thus, experts said there is a need for a dedicated, independent watchdog to be formed to police the variety of harms online and focus on helping victims seek redress. Ms Toor said Australia\u2019s watchdog eSafety could be a good reference, referring to its regime as \u201cthe gold standard\u201d.eSafety was granted powers in 2022 to direct social media firms in Australia to remove flagged harmful content within 24 hours or face penalties.\u00a0It acts on reports of serious online abuse when content on the Internet is likely to harm the physical or mental health of the person targeted.\u00a0 Citizens can report cases including the cyber bullying of young people and children, adult cyber abuse through menacing or harassing messages, and image-based abuse like the spreading of intimate content without consent. It will also investigate material linked to sexual exploitation, pro-terrorism and those that promote crime. eSafety can also order online platforms to hand over user information and contact details, like IP addresses, e-mails, names and phone numbers for investigation. Corporations that do not comply face up to A$156,500 (S$136,000) in fines.\u00a0It is also responsible for public education and coordinating online safety with other countries as the Internet is global, said eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant in an interview with ST in September. She said: \u201cThe business models of many of these social media sites don\u2019t lend themselves to wanting to tackle (online harms) because engagement and conflict sells. If they start removing fake and imposter accounts en masse, that affects their daily and monthly active user numbers, which attract advertisers.\u201dThe watchdog will tighten the leash on tech companies if needed. eSafety famously issued a legal notice in June to X, formerly known as Twitter, to demand an explanation of what the social media giant is doing to combat a surge in online hate speech since billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition. It threatened to fine the company up to A$700,000 for every day of delay if X does not respond with factual and truthful information within 28 days. The move has since forced a response from X, and eSafety is thinking about publishing a summary of that response.Ms Inman Grant said: \u201cI have specific powers to name and shame, but I try to be fair and use due process and this is what the transparency powers does\u2026 It lets me lift the hood of these tech companies and see what companies are actually doing.\u201d\u00a0In September, the watchdog also openly criticised Apple for halting the development of tools to scan for child abuse material before they are uploaded to its iCloud service on its devices due to privacy concerns. Instead, Apple chose to use prompts to warn children about sending or receiving explicit images. Meanwhile, Meta, Microsoft and Google provide these tools. Even so, Ms Inman Grant said there is a delicate dance that has to happen when calling out companies. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in a permanent state of conflict with platforms because part of the work that I do is remediating online harms in real time when our citizens are abused.\u201d Experts said a single agency to address online harm makes it clear for victims to know where they can get help. Dr Soon said victims often want a single port of call given the stress and trauma they face. \u201cThe ability to get in touch with an authority that is not faceless and who can act on the victim\u2019s behalf will bring some relief and comfort to the victim as action is being taken,\u201d she said. Prof Tan said such an agency needs sufficient enforcement levers such as those that eSafety possesses to deal with complaints fast and require platforms to \u201cdisgorge\u201d the identities of perpetrators. He added: \u201cMy own reading is that the authorities are looking at the Australian experience closely, and I won\u2019t be surprised if we have a similar model adapted to the local context.\u201dBritish MP Damian Collins, who chaired a Joint Committee on the United Kingdom\u2019s draft Online Safety Bill passed in September said that having a dedicated regulatory body will go a long way in making the Internet a healthier environment by ensuring swift action against extreme or illegal content, such as those related to self-harm or inciting violence. Hidden in the shadowsEve was kept in the dark about the identity of the woman who harassed her, even after the woman was given an official warning. \u201cI felt very defenceless not knowing who she was then,\u201d said Eve. \u201cShe is still out there. She can walk past me at any time and I wouldn\u2019t even recognise her.\u201d \u201cPeople online tend to think that posting whatever they want is not a big deal. They wouldn\u2019t speak like how they would in real life.\u201d Experts pointed to anonymity as the fuel for online abuse, suggesting that removing the veil would help quicken resolution for victims.With no clue of the perpetrator\u2019s identity at the time and who might have seen the posts, Eve said it was difficult to trust others then. Time is critical for those in even more embarrassing situations, she added.\u00a0SMU\u2019s Prof Tan said that a huge step to curb online harms is to have social media companies require some personal identification information during registration, which must be surrendered to the authorities in the event of online abuse.Doing so has to be a policy from the authorities, as some platforms might prefer not to hold on to users\u2019 identifiable details so that they are not responsible for their posts, said Prof Tan. \u201cIt can be a phone number, or even something temporary, as long as it is traceable,\u201d he suggested. \u201cIf there is some common standard among platforms, it will signal to potential offenders that you can be traced and that anonymity is just a veil.\u201d\u00a0In Australia, eSafety is granted information-gathering powers to order Internet platforms to hand over user information and contact details for investigations. Its spokesman said: \u201cBy identifying these end-users, eSafety can then issue them with legal notices to remove the material and, in some cases, refrain from posting more abusive material.\u201dLooking to the futureThe authorities worldwide are gearing up to rein in artificial intelligence (AI), which if uncontrolled, can complicate online harms further.\u00a0In September, naked images generated by AI of local young girls in the Spanish town of Almendralejo that spread online without the victims\u2019 knowledge shook the world into realising that AI had arrived to complicate online harms further.\u00a0The pictures were created using photos of the targeted girls fully clothed and processed by an app that generates an imagined image of the person without clothes.More than 20 girls have come forward as victims and at least 11 local boys were identified to be involved in creating or spreading the pictures on WhatsApp and Telegram, BBC reported.But it is not clear if the group\u2019s alleged actions constitute a crime as the Spanish authorities investigate the matter.\u00a0Meanwhile, the United States\u2019 Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in June that criminals were increasingly using AI to create sexually explicit images to threaten victims and similar cases have popped up in other parts of Spain. AI-generated abuse is among threats on the horizon that eSafety is keeping tabs on, said Ms Inman Grant. Generative AI can be helpful in content moderation and scanning for harmful material, but it is also used to create child sexual abuse content, she said.\u00a0The commission works with tech companies to promote safety by design \u2013 a practice of anticipating online harms before they occur, instead of retrofitting them after an issue has surfaced, she said.\u00a0Ms Inman Grant said: \u201cWhat if these companies utilise (these tools) to prevent the mass creation of fake accounts? They should be using AI tools to detect words that might be offensive to prevent them from reaching their intended target.\u201dSingapore has similarly adopted a collaborative approach and in June banded with at least 60 global industry players to tackle pressing issues in AI, including deepfakes. The alliance includes the likes of Google, Meta and Microsoft, and according to a report by the Infocomm Media Development Authority, will seek solutions for remedial action if harmful content is generated.  For Eve, it took months to overcome the feeling of paranoia, afraid that her harasser was stalking her. She urged other victims to seek help, such as through support centres like SheCares@SCWO, which provided her with counselling and offered legal advice. \u201cDon\u2019t suffer in silence, because it will only add on to the mental stress,\u201d said Eve. She said clearer laws and instructions on how victims can seek recourse will go a long way to helping them to deal with online harms. \u201cI\u2019m not trained in law, so when I was going through all this, I had to learn how I am protected and what my rights are. I was scanning through as many articles as I could find online, but I wasn\u2019t sure which were still relevant,\u201d said Eve. \u201cThis is something that we can surely look at.\u201d Additional reporting by Zhaki Abdullah Correction note: This article has been updated to reflect Dr Carol Soon\u2019s and Ms Simran Toor\u2019s correct job designations.

        "Text":"SINGAPORE \u2013 Amos Yee is out on parole, barely halfway into his six-year jail term in the United States for grooming a teenage girl and possessing child pornography.The Singaporean, who was sentenced on Dec 2, 2021, was listed as being out of custody on Saturday afternoon (Singapore time) on the VINELink mobile app, which notifies victims of crimes on the current status of offenders.He had been housed in the Illinois River Correctional Centre \u2013 a medium-security state prison in Fulton County, Illinois \u2013 about a three-hour drive from Chicago. He was expected to be released only on Oct 8, 2026.The 24-year-old\u2019s jail term had been backdated to his arrest in October 2020.At the time of his offences, he was only 20 and living in Cook County, Chicago.In February 2019, he repeatedly requested that the victim \u2013 a 14-year-old girl who lived in Texas \u2013 provide photos of herself in the nude, with him returning in kind.He also engaged in role play and sexual fantasies with her, and exchanged thousands of messages.The Chicago Sun-Times daily newspaper reported then that the girl had repeatedly brought up her age in messages with Yee on WhatsApp, the messaging platform on which they communicated.Yee then instructed her to remove her age from her WhatsApp profile.During his sentencing, he had an additional 16 other child pornography-related charges dismissed as part of a plea deal he accepted.As a result of his offences, he is required to be listed on the sex offender registry, and also faces possible deportation from the US as his asylum status could be revoked.At his sentencing in December 2021, he had been advised by Judge Carol Howard that pleading guilty to the charges meant he could be deported, denied admission to the US, or denied naturalisation as a US citizen in the future. The convictions could also affect his ability to obtain housing, employment and other licences, including a driving licence.The Straits Times has contacted the US Department of Justice to find out the conditions of Yee\u2019s parole, as well as US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to learn if he will be deported.Yee had fled Singapore for the US in December 2016, a day before he was supposed to report for a medical examination ahead of his enlistment into national service.He was granted political asylum in the US in 2017 after citing persecution for his political opinions, following two separate incidents that saw him jailed twice in Singapore.In 2015, he was given a four-week jail sentence after being charged with engaging in hate speech against Christians in a video he had posted on YouTube, as well as publishing an obscene image of former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew.The following year, he was charged with engaging in hate speech again after he deliberately made comments in videos and blog posts that were derogatory of Christianity and Islam. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six weeks\u2019 jail and a $2,000 fine.ST has contacted the Ministry of Home Affairs to find out if Yee will be detained if he were to be deported back here.",

        "combined":"Title: S\u2019porean Amos Yee released from US prison after serving half of 6-year term for sex-related offences; Content: SINGAPORE \u2013 Amos Yee is out on parole, barely halfway into his six-year jail term in the United States for grooming a teenage girl and possessing child pornography.The Singaporean, who was sentenced on Dec 2, 2021, was listed as being out of custody on Saturday afternoon (Singapore time) on the VINELink mobile app, which notifies victims of crimes on the current status of offenders.He had been housed in the Illinois River Correctional Centre \u2013 a medium-security state prison in Fulton County, Illinois \u2013 about a three-hour drive from Chicago. He was expected to be released only on Oct 8, 2026.The 24-year-old\u2019s jail term had been backdated to his arrest in October 2020.At the time of his offences, he was only 20 and living in Cook County, Chicago.In February 2019, he repeatedly requested that the victim \u2013 a 14-year-old girl who lived in Texas \u2013 provide photos of herself in the nude, with him returning in kind.He also engaged in role play and sexual fantasies with her, and exchanged thousands of messages.The Chicago Sun-Times daily newspaper reported then that the girl had repeatedly brought up her age in messages with Yee on WhatsApp, the messaging platform on which they communicated.Yee then instructed her to remove her age from her WhatsApp profile.During his sentencing, he had an additional 16 other child pornography-related charges dismissed as part of a plea deal he accepted.As a result of his offences, he is required to be listed on the sex offender registry, and also faces possible deportation from the US as his asylum status could be revoked.At his sentencing in December 2021, he had been advised by Judge Carol Howard that pleading guilty to the charges meant he could be deported, denied admission to the US, or denied naturalisation as a US citizen in the future. The convictions could also affect his ability to obtain housing, employment and other licences, including a driving licence.The Straits Times has contacted the US Department of Justice to find out the conditions of Yee\u2019s parole, as well as US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to learn if he will be deported.Yee had fled Singapore for the US in December 2016, a day before he was supposed to report for a medical examination ahead of his enlistment into national service.He was granted political asylum in the US in 2017 after citing persecution for his political opinions, following two separate incidents that saw him jailed twice in Singapore.In 2015, he was given a four-week jail sentence after being charged with engaging in hate speech against Christians in a video he had posted on YouTube, as well as publishing an obscene image of former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew.The following year, he was charged with engaging in hate speech again after he deliberately made comments in videos and blog posts that were derogatory of Christianity and Islam. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six weeks\u2019 jail and a $2,000 fine.ST has contacted the Ministry of Home Affairs to find out if Yee will be detained if he were to be deported back here."

        "Text":"SINGAPORE - There is no spike in the number of children being abused to death by their loved ones, and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has strengthened protocols to look out for vulnerable children under the state\u2019s care.Since November 2020, MSF has \u201cfurther strengthened\u201d protocols on information-sharing and coordination with various agencies to look out for such children to ensure their well-being, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli said in a written reply on Tuesday to a parliamentary question by Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas).He added that the improvements include specific procedures to guide agencies to trace a child\u2019s whereabouts if he has not been seen regularly in the community.Mr Yong had asked MSF for updates on safeguards to ensure the safety of children in foster care who have returned home to their parents and for the length of time MSF continues to check on their well-being.On Sept 19, a 35-year-old man was sentenced to 21\u00bd years\u2019 jail and 18 strokes of the cane for causing his two-year-old daughter\u2019s death. He had slapped the girl, Umaisyah, forcefully multiple times and failed to provide her with medical aid. To cover up the crime, he and his wife burned Umaisyah\u2019s body in a metal pot and hid it in a box under the stove in their home.Umaisyah had been placed in foster care since she was three to four months old as her father was in a drug rehabilitation centre, while his wife was assessed to be unable to take care of the girl.She was returned to them about two years later, but the father abused her until she died in 2014.The couple spun various lies to hide her death, including to an Education Ministry officer who contacted them to find out why she was not registered for Primary 1.The crime was uncovered only five years later when Umaisyah\u2019s uncle found the pot and showed it to his friends, who reported the discovery to the police.Replying to Mr Yong\u2019s question, Mr Masagos said foster care officers will continue to work with MSF\u2019s community partners after the abused child returns to his family from foster care. They will monitor the child and his family, and ensure regular safety checks are made.Such support is given for a year or more after the child is reunited with his family. The exact duration for each case depends on the family\u2019s needs.He added that since June 2020, MSF has trained more than 7,100 people to spot and report signs of family violence.\u00a0Mr Masagos said incidences of child abuse remain low, but he did not give a figure.He said: \u201cThe recent incidents presented before the courts had occurred in different years and do not represent a spike in child death cases due to abuse.\u201cNonetheless, any abuse is one case too many... MSF will continue our efforts to extend our training and outreach and continually review our safeguards to ensure the safety of vulnerable children.\u201dAt least three other cases where a child died after being abused by a parent or parent\u2019s partner were heard in court in 2023.An 11-year-old girl was beaten to death by her stepfather in 2020 after being repeatedly abused by him and her mother. They made her eat chilli padi, splashed hot water on her and hit her with a belt to punish her.Among other charges, the man pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide in February, while the mother pleaded guilty to, among other charges, one of failing to take steps to protect the girl from the fatal assault. In July, a 43-year-old man was tried for murdering his five-year-old daughter in 2017. He had confined the girl and her younger brother naked in the toilet, letting them out only for meals or when someone needed to use the toilet.In 2022, a 30-year-old man was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for murdering his former girlfriend\u2019s son in 2019. The man appealed against his murder conviction, claiming that the nine-month-old baby had accidentally fallen out of his arms and hit his head.In September, the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal.",

        "combined":"Title: No spike in number of children abused to death: MSF; Content: SINGAPORE - There is no spike in the number of children being abused to death by their loved ones, and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has strengthened protocols to look out for vulnerable children under the state\u2019s care.Since November 2020, MSF has \u201cfurther strengthened\u201d protocols on information-sharing and coordination with various agencies to look out for such children to ensure their well-being, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli said in a written reply on Tuesday to a parliamentary question by Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas).He added that the improvements include specific procedures to guide agencies to trace a child\u2019s whereabouts if he has not been seen regularly in the community.Mr Yong had asked MSF for updates on safeguards to ensure the safety of children in foster care who have returned home to their parents and for the length of time MSF continues to check on their well-being.On Sept 19, a 35-year-old man was sentenced to 21\u00bd years\u2019 jail and 18 strokes of the cane for causing his two-year-old daughter\u2019s death. He had slapped the girl, Umaisyah, forcefully multiple times and failed to provide her with medical aid. To cover up the crime, he and his wife burned Umaisyah\u2019s body in a metal pot and hid it in a box under the stove in their home.Umaisyah had been placed in foster care since she was three to four months old as her father was in a drug rehabilitation centre, while his wife was assessed to be unable to take care of the girl.She was returned to them about two years later, but the father abused her until she died in 2014.The couple spun various lies to hide her death, including to an Education Ministry officer who contacted them to find out why she was not registered for Primary 1.The crime was uncovered only five years later when Umaisyah\u2019s uncle found the pot and showed it to his friends, who reported the discovery to the police.Replying to Mr Yong\u2019s question, Mr Masagos said foster care officers will continue to work with MSF\u2019s community partners after the abused child returns to his family from foster care. They will monitor the child and his family, and ensure regular safety checks are made.Such support is given for a year or more after the child is reunited with his family. The exact duration for each case depends on the family\u2019s needs.He added that since June 2020, MSF has trained more than 7,100 people to spot and report signs of family violence.\u00a0Mr Masagos said incidences of child abuse remain low, but he did not give a figure.He said: \u201cThe recent incidents presented before the courts had occurred in different years and do not represent a spike in child death cases due to abuse.\u201cNonetheless, any abuse is one case too many... MSF will continue our efforts to extend our training and outreach and continually review our safeguards to ensure the safety of vulnerable children.\u201dAt least three other cases where a child died after being abused by a parent or parent\u2019s partner were heard in court in 2023.An 11-year-old girl was beaten to death by her stepfather in 2020 after being repeatedly abused by him and her mother. They made her eat chilli padi, splashed hot water on her and hit her with a belt to punish her.Among other charges, the man pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide in February, while the mother pleaded guilty to, among other charges, one of failing to take steps to protect the girl from the fatal assault. In July, a 43-year-old man was tried for murdering his five-year-old daughter in 2017. He had confined the girl and her younger brother naked in the toilet, letting them out only for meals or when someone needed to use the toilet.In 2022, a 30-year-old man was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for murdering his former girlfriend\u2019s son in 2019. The man appealed against his murder conviction, claiming that the nine-month-old baby had accidentally fallen out of his arms and hit his head.In September, the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal."

        "Text":"NEW YORK \u2013 The police in Peru have arrested a man suspected of perpetrating a wave of bomb threats against US schools, synagogues, hospitals and airports, triggering evacuations, flight delays and other disruptions in five states in September, the authorities said on Thursday.Eddie Manuel Nunez Santos, 33, of Lima, Peru, is accused of making 150 bomb threats in all, some directed at Jewish institutions on the Rosh Hashanah holiday, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York said in a press release.All threats proved to be hoaxes, it added. A Department of Justice spokesperson said his motive in some cases was to get young people to send him sexually explicit photos, and he would threaten to set off the bombs if they failed to do so.It was not immediately known whether Nunez Santos, who faced extradition to the United States under a federal indictment in New York City, had obtained legal representation.The alleged threats, conveyed by e-mail, were directed at supposed targets in New York City as well as in Alaska, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Arizona, officials said in the press statement.\u201cI placed multiple bombs in all of the schools from your school districts. The bombs will blow up in a few hours. I\u2019ll gladly smile when your families are crying because of your deaths,\u201d a threat cited as an example by prosecutors read.That message prompted the evacuation of 1,100 students from 20 schools in Pennsylvania, the authorities said.The alleged threats \u201ccaused an immediate mobilisation by federal and state authorities, diverting critical law enforcement and public safety resources, and caused fear in hundreds of communities across this country\u201d, US attorney Damian Williams said in the statement.The eight-page indictment charges Nunez Santos with two felony counts related to messages he is accused of sending to multiple recipients in New York \u2013 making threatening interstate communications and perpetrating a hoax. Each carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.He was also charged with attempted sexual exploitation of a child, attempted coercion and enticement of a minor and attempted receipt of child pornography. Those charges, for which he could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted, stem from his alleged attempt at persuading a 15-year-old girl in Westchester, New York, to send him sexually explicit photos. The investigation was led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s New York Joint Terrorism Task Force. The authorities tracked Nunez Santos through his Internet and telephone communications, according to the press statement. REUTERS",

        "combined":"Title: Peruvian national arrested on suspicion of making 150 US bomb threats; Content: NEW YORK \u2013 The police in Peru have arrested a man suspected of perpetrating a wave of bomb threats against US schools, synagogues, hospitals and airports, triggering evacuations, flight delays and other disruptions in five states in September, the authorities said on Thursday.Eddie Manuel Nunez Santos, 33, of Lima, Peru, is accused of making 150 bomb threats in all, some directed at Jewish institutions on the Rosh Hashanah holiday, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York said in a press release.All threats proved to be hoaxes, it added. A Department of Justice spokesperson said his motive in some cases was to get young people to send him sexually explicit photos, and he would threaten to set off the bombs if they failed to do so.It was not immediately known whether Nunez Santos, who faced extradition to the United States under a federal indictment in New York City, had obtained legal representation.The alleged threats, conveyed by e-mail, were directed at supposed targets in New York City as well as in Alaska, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Arizona, officials said in the press statement.\u201cI placed multiple bombs in all of the schools from your school districts. The bombs will blow up in a few hours. I\u2019ll gladly smile when your families are crying because of your deaths,\u201d a threat cited as an example by prosecutors read.That message prompted the evacuation of 1,100 students from 20 schools in Pennsylvania, the authorities said.The alleged threats \u201ccaused an immediate mobilisation by federal and state authorities, diverting critical law enforcement and public safety resources, and caused fear in hundreds of communities across this country\u201d, US attorney Damian Williams said in the statement.The eight-page indictment charges Nunez Santos with two felony counts related to messages he is accused of sending to multiple recipients in New York \u2013 making threatening interstate communications and perpetrating a hoax. Each carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.He was also charged with attempted sexual exploitation of a child, attempted coercion and enticement of a minor and attempted receipt of child pornography. Those charges, for which he could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted, stem from his alleged attempt at persuading a 15-year-old girl in Westchester, New York, to send him sexually explicit photos. The investigation was led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s New York Joint Terrorism Task Force. The authorities tracked Nunez Santos through his Internet and telephone communications, according to the press statement. REUTERS"

        "Text":"SINGAPORE \u2013 A 20-year-old man who had unreciprocated feelings for a female friend told her that there were ghosts following her, while assuring her that he was a temple medium who could get rid of the spirits for her.Over several days in 2019, under the pretext of performing consecration rituals, the man sexually exploited the 22-year-old woman, escalating from molesting her to eventually raping her. He even tried to get her pregnant so that she would be forced to remain with him.On Thursday, the man, who is now 23, was sentenced to a prison term of 18 years, 11 months and three weeks, and 16 strokes of the cane.He pleaded guilty in the High Court to two charges of rape and one charge of sexual assault by penetration.  Four other charges were taken into consideration. The offences took place between July 22 and 27, 2019. He cannot be named under a gag order to protect the identity of the victim, who is now 25.\u00a0Deputy Public Prosecutor Emily Koh told the court that the man and the woman first got to know each other in secondary school. The victim addressed the man as \u201ckor\u201d, meaning elder brother, despite him being younger than she was. In mid-2019, the man contacted the victim on Facebook, and they rekindled their friendship. He drove her to and from work and had dinner with her and another friend. He developed romantic feelings for the victim, but she was still interested in her former boyfriend.\u00a0Shortly before the offences were committed, the man told the victim that he had been helping at a temple and was a medium for the rabbit companion of Chinese mythological character Chang\u00a0Er. He also took her to the temple.On July 21, 2019, while they were at the victim\u2019s home, the man told her that there were spirits following her and her sister, and that there were ghosts in the flat. He assured her that he could perform consecration rituals to get rid of the ghosts, so that no harm would come to the two women. To perpetuate the ruse, he gave the victim some amulets and talismans.During these \u201crituals\u201d, the man chanted prayers and drew talisman markings on her body with his finger. The victim was fully clothed on the first few occasions. Subsequently, the man told her that she had to take off all her clothes, and deceived her into believing that sexual acts were part of the rituals.During one purported ritual on July 25, 2019, he convinced the victim that sex was required as part of the ritual.The prosecutor said: \u201cHe had only told the victim that it was necessary for the consecration ritual because he knew that the victim would not agree to having sex with him otherwise.\u201dAfter a second rape on July 27, 2019, the woman was advised by her friends to lodge a police report after she told them what he had done to her. She did so two days later.On Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Sruthi Boppana sought 17 to 23 years\u2019 jail and 16 strokes of the cane. She argued that the element of premeditation in the case was further aggravated by the degree of deception involved. She added that the victim \u2013 who was assessed in 2020 to have below average range of functioning \u2013 was defenceless against falsehoods the man had spun. ",

        "combined":"Title: Man who raped friend to help her \u2018get rid of ghosts\u2019 gets nearly 19 years\u2019 jail; Content: SINGAPORE \u2013 A 20-year-old man who had unreciprocated feelings for a female friend told her that there were ghosts following her, while assuring her that he was a temple medium who could get rid of the spirits for her.Over several days in 2019, under the pretext of performing consecration rituals, the man sexually exploited the 22-year-old woman, escalating from molesting her to eventually raping her. He even tried to get her pregnant so that she would be forced to remain with him.On Thursday, the man, who is now 23, was sentenced to a prison term of 18 years, 11 months and three weeks, and 16 strokes of the cane.He pleaded guilty in the High Court to two charges of rape and one charge of sexual assault by penetration.  Four other charges were taken into consideration. The offences took place between July 22 and 27, 2019. He cannot be named under a gag order to protect the identity of the victim, who is now 25.\u00a0Deputy Public Prosecutor Emily Koh told the court that the man and the woman first got to know each other in secondary school. The victim addressed the man as \u201ckor\u201d, meaning elder brother, despite him being younger than she was. In mid-2019, the man contacted the victim on Facebook, and they rekindled their friendship. He drove her to and from work and had dinner with her and another friend. He developed romantic feelings for the victim, but she was still interested in her former boyfriend.\u00a0Shortly before the offences were committed, the man told the victim that he had been helping at a temple and was a medium for the rabbit companion of Chinese mythological character Chang\u00a0Er. He also took her to the temple.On July 21, 2019, while they were at the victim\u2019s home, the man told her that there were spirits following her and her sister, and that there were ghosts in the flat. He assured her that he could perform consecration rituals to get rid of the ghosts, so that no harm would come to the two women. To perpetuate the ruse, he gave the victim some amulets and talismans.During these \u201crituals\u201d, the man chanted prayers and drew talisman markings on her body with his finger. The victim was fully clothed on the first few occasions. Subsequently, the man told her that she had to take off all her clothes, and deceived her into believing that sexual acts were part of the rituals.During one purported ritual on July 25, 2019, he convinced the victim that sex was required as part of the ritual.The prosecutor said: \u201cHe had only told the victim that it was necessary for the consecration ritual because he knew that the victim would not agree to having sex with him otherwise.\u201dAfter a second rape on July 27, 2019, the woman was advised by her friends to lodge a police report after she told them what he had done to her. She did so two days later.On Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Sruthi Boppana sought 17 to 23 years\u2019 jail and 16 strokes of the cane. She argued that the element of premeditation in the case was further aggravated by the degree of deception involved. She added that the victim \u2013 who was assessed in 2020 to have below average range of functioning \u2013 was defenceless against falsehoods the man had spun."

        "Text":"SINGAPORE \u2013 Secretly attracted to his former colleague, a married male teacher created a social media account in her name and impersonated her for two years.He used the account to chat with current and former students of the school about sex, including what sexual activities the students wanted to do with the female teacher.The matter came to light only when the police found photos of the female teacher on a student\u2019s phone while investigating a complaint he had lodged about a different case.On Thursday, the 38-year-old man was jailed for 16 weeks after pleading guilty earlier to a charge under the Protection from Harassment Act.Both teachers cannot be named to protect the victim and students\u2019 identities.Court documents said the teachers worked in the same school between 2011 and 2014. While they taught different subjects, they became close friends.In 2014, the male teacher left the school for a new posting. However, he kept in touch with the victim by messaging her and meeting her in person.But both their spouses became uncomfortable with this relationship, and they stopped contacting each other by 2016.But the man had feelings for the victim, and missed her.In December 2018, he created a social media account in her name and uploaded photographs of her to the account. They included some which he had taken without her knowledge when they were colleagues.Deputy Public Prosecutor Huo Jiongrui said the man had uploaded them to the account because he wanted to look at her photographs, but she had blocked him from her real account.Between December 2018 and February 2021, the man used the account to hold 589 conversations with different people, most of whom were current or former students of the school.Of these conversations, 49 were sexual in nature.He acted as a sexually active older woman, and imagined himself as a student receiving sexual advances from this woman.He had often fantasised about having sex with older women, said DPP Huo.Court documents described two students whom the accused contacted through the account.The boys believed it was the female teacher who was communicating with them, and one sent sexually explicit photos.The police arrested the man in February 2021. Since then, he has been suspended by the Ministry of Education (MOE) from all duties and has been drawing half-month\u2019s salary.In response to The Straits Times\u2019 queries, an MOE spokesman confirmed on Sept 7 that the male teacher is no longer teaching in any school. \u201cMOE takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to our standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service,\u201d said the spokesman.More than two years after the arrest, the female teacher said in her victim impact statement that she has a constant fear that former students would have talked about her.She also suffered sleepless nights, believing the contents of the conversations in her name would continue to circulate online.Said DPP Huo: \u201cShe continues to fear what the accused is capable of doing next. She hopes he will leave her alone, and hates him now, despite them being friends and colleagues before.\u201dThe DPP called for the male teacher to be jailed for between seven and eight months, noting that his motive for stalking the victim in such a manner was highly egregious.Said DPP Huo: \u201cHe role-played as a heavily sexualised version of the victim from his fantasies, and then imagined himself as his young targets to enjoy the pleasure of his own artificial advances. This way, his young targets were nothing more than a prop for his perversions.\u201dHowever, District Judge Chua Wei Yuan said this was overstated. Said Judge Chua: \u201cOn the spectrum of motives for a stalking offence, this is neither at the most malicious end, nor at the most benign end of the scale.\u201dThe judge described the acts as repugnant, but said it did not appear that the students were unwilling participants in the conversations.The prosecution is considering appealing against the length of the sentence.",

        "combined":"Title: Jail for male teacher who impersonated female ex-colleague, discussed sexual fantasies with students; Content: SINGAPORE \u2013 Secretly attracted to his former colleague, a married male teacher created a social media account in her name and impersonated her for two years.He used the account to chat with current and former students of the school about sex, including what sexual activities the students wanted to do with the female teacher.The matter came to light only when the police found photos of the female teacher on a student\u2019s phone while investigating a complaint he had lodged about a different case.On Thursday, the 38-year-old man was jailed for 16 weeks after pleading guilty earlier to a charge under the Protection from Harassment Act.Both teachers cannot be named to protect the victim and students\u2019 identities.Court documents said the teachers worked in the same school between 2011 and 2014. While they taught different subjects, they became close friends.In 2014, the male teacher left the school for a new posting. However, he kept in touch with the victim by messaging her and meeting her in person.But both their spouses became uncomfortable with this relationship, and they stopped contacting each other by 2016.But the man had feelings for the victim, and missed her.In December 2018, he created a social media account in her name and uploaded photographs of her to the account. They included some which he had taken without her knowledge when they were colleagues.Deputy Public Prosecutor Huo Jiongrui said the man had uploaded them to the account because he wanted to look at her photographs, but she had blocked him from her real account.Between December 2018 and February 2021, the man used the account to hold 589 conversations with different people, most of whom were current or former students of the school.Of these conversations, 49 were sexual in nature.He acted as a sexually active older woman, and imagined himself as a student receiving sexual advances from this woman.He had often fantasised about having sex with older women, said DPP Huo.Court documents described two students whom the accused contacted through the account.The boys believed it was the female teacher who was communicating with them, and one sent sexually explicit photos.The police arrested the man in February 2021. Since then, he has been suspended by the Ministry of Education (MOE) from all duties and has been drawing half-month\u2019s salary.In response to The Straits Times\u2019 queries, an MOE spokesman confirmed on Sept 7 that the male teacher is no longer teaching in any school. \u201cMOE takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to our standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service,\u201d said the spokesman.More than two years after the arrest, the female teacher said in her victim impact statement that she has a constant fear that former students would have talked about her.She also suffered sleepless nights, believing the contents of the conversations in her name would continue to circulate online.Said DPP Huo: \u201cShe continues to fear what the accused is capable of doing next. She hopes he will leave her alone, and hates him now, despite them being friends and colleagues before.\u201dThe DPP called for the male teacher to be jailed for between seven and eight months, noting that his motive for stalking the victim in such a manner was highly egregious.Said DPP Huo: \u201cHe role-played as a heavily sexualised version of the victim from his fantasies, and then imagined himself as his young targets to enjoy the pleasure of his own artificial advances. This way, his young targets were nothing more than a prop for his perversions.\u201dHowever, District Judge Chua Wei Yuan said this was overstated. Said Judge Chua: \u201cOn the spectrum of motives for a stalking offence, this is neither at the most malicious end, nor at the most benign end of the scale.\u201dThe judge described the acts as repugnant, but said it did not appear that the students were unwilling participants in the conversations.The prosecution is considering appealing against the length of the sentence."

        "Text":"SINGAPORE - A teenager was made to feel like a \u201csex slave\u201d by her brother-in-law, a man she regarded as a brother but who really was a predator who sexually abused her from when she was about nine years old.The court heard that on one occasion in 2017, he raped her after watching pornography on his mobile phone.She had desperately tried to stop him, by blocking the door to her room with the television set she had. The man\u2019s wife \u2013 the victim\u2019s eldest sister \u2013 was not home at the time, and the rest of the family members were all asleep. The man, now 40, only stopped when he heard the victim\u2019s mother opening her bedroom door. The girl, who is now 21, was between 14 and 15 years old then.The man was sentenced to 18 years\u2019 jail and 16 strokes of the cane on Monday, after he pleaded guilty to a charge of rape and another charge of sexual penetration of a minor. Ten charges involving sexual offences against the same victim were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.His lawyer Ryan David Lim said his client did not contest the charges, and had pleaded guilty to spare the victim from having to testify in court. The man was hoping to be given 10 strokes of the cane.But the perpetrator, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victim\u2019s identity, was sentenced to more strokes by District Judge Terence Tay, who described the offences as heinous and the acts as revolting.The man had married the victim\u2019s sister in 2009, and they lived in a flat with their four children, the victim and her parents until 2020.\u201cThe victim and the accused shared a close relationship, in that the victim treated the accused like a brother and trusted him,\u201d said deputy public prosecutors Yohanes Ng and Teo Lu Jia.On five occasions in 2012 and 2013 before dropping the girl off at school or while they were out running errands, the offender drove her to a secluded carpark and performed a sex act on her, causing her to feel pain.He also got her to perform sex acts on him during that period. The man was around 28 years old and she was about nine.The prosecution said he decided to take advantage of his sister-in-law after watching pornographic videos of sexual acts committed against young teenagers.The offences came to light when the victim made a police report on March 14, 2022, on her boyfriend\u2019s urging. The man was arrested the next day. The victim did not tell anyone about the abuse earlier as she wanted her family members to be on good terms, and because she did not want to make things \u201cmore messy\u201d.Said the prosecution: \u201cShe was also concerned that no one would believe her, and she also did not want to affect her sister\u2019s marriage with the accused. She also felt close to the accused as he was a family member who occasionally gave her extra pocket money. \u201cHowever, she felt like the accused\u2019s \u2018sex slave\u2019 due to his actions.\u201dThe prosecutors argued for him to be sentenced to between 18 and 20 years\u2019 jail, with 16 to 20 strokes of the cane.They highlighted the importance of general deterrence, and noted the difficulty in detecting intra-familial sexual abuse and the barriers faced by victims in reporting such crimes.They added that such offences involving minors generate public disquiet and aversion.Mr Lim said his client has since divorced the victim\u2019s sister and started a new relationship with a fellow divorcee.

        "combined":"Title: Jail, cane for man who sexually abused his teenage sister-in-law, made her feel like \u2018sex slave\u2019; Content: SINGAPORE - A teenager was made to feel like a \u201csex slave\u201d by her brother-in-law, a man she regarded as a brother but who really was a predator who sexually abused her from when she was about nine years old.The court heard that on one occasion in 2017, he raped her after watching pornography on his mobile phone.She had desperately tried to stop him, by blocking the door to her room with the television set she had. The man\u2019s wife \u2013 the victim\u2019s eldest sister \u2013 was not home at the time, and the rest of the family members were all asleep. The man, now 40, only stopped when he heard the victim\u2019s mother opening her bedroom door. The girl, who is now 21, was between 14 and 15 years old then.The man was sentenced to 18 years\u2019 jail and 16 strokes of the cane on Monday, after he pleaded guilty to a charge of rape and another charge of sexual penetration of a minor. Ten charges involving sexual offences against the same victim were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.His lawyer Ryan David Lim said his client did not contest the charges, and had pleaded guilty to spare the victim from having to testify in court. The man was hoping to be given 10 strokes of the cane.But the perpetrator, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victim\u2019s identity, was sentenced to more strokes by District Judge Terence Tay, who described the offences as heinous and the acts as revolting.The man had married the victim\u2019s sister in 2009, and they lived in a flat with their four children, the victim and her parents until 2020.\u201cThe victim and the accused shared a close relationship, in that the victim treated the accused like a brother and trusted him,\u201d said deputy public prosecutors Yohanes Ng and Teo Lu Jia.On five occasions in 2012 and 2013 before dropping the girl off at school or while they were out running errands, the offender drove her to a secluded carpark and performed a sex act on her, causing her to feel pain.He also got her to perform sex acts on him during that period. The man was around 28 years old and she was about nine.The prosecution said he decided to take advantage of his sister-in-law after watching pornographic videos of sexual acts committed against young teenagers.The offences came to light when the victim made a police report on March 14, 2022, on her boyfriend\u2019s urging. The man was arrested the next day. The victim did not tell anyone about the abuse earlier as she wanted her family members to be on good terms, and because she did not want to make things \u201cmore messy\u201d.Said the prosecution: \u201cShe was also concerned that no one would believe her, and she also did not want to affect her sister\u2019s marriage with the accused. She also felt close to the accused as he was a family member who occasionally gave her extra pocket money. \u201cHowever, she felt like the accused\u2019s \u2018sex slave\u2019 due to his actions.\u201dThe prosecutors argued for him to be sentenced to between 18 and 20 years\u2019 jail, with 16 to 20 strokes of the cane.They highlighted the importance of general deterrence, and noted the difficulty in detecting intra-familial sexual abuse and the barriers faced by victims in reporting such crimes.They added that such offences involving minors generate public disquiet and aversion.Mr Lim said his client has since divorced the victim\u2019s sister and started a new relationship with a fellow divorcee."
