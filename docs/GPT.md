## Feature Engineering
Date Parsing: Convert publishing, creation, and edited dates into a uniform datetime format. This is crucial as these features will be pivotal in timeline generation.
Tag Normalization: Standardize and deduplicate tags generated by the llama3 model.


## Step 2: Article Embedding and Tagging

## 2.1 Embedding Generation
If not all articles are embedded: Utilize the same model or technique used to generate existing embeddings to process any new or missed articles to maintain consistency.
## 2.2 Tag Generation
Use a pre-trained llama3 model to generate 3-5 tags for any new articles that come in without tags.



Step 4 of your project, the "Similarity and Retrieval Mechanism," is crucial for ensuring that the articles retrieved are relevant to the creation of an accurate and insightful timeline. Here's how you can approach each sub-step in detail, incorporating appropriate machine learning and AI techniques:

### 4.1 Defining Similarity
The objective here is to retrieve articles that are contextually related to a given new article (Article A). You'll do this in two stages: tag-based filtering and embedding similarity.

#### Tag-Based Filtering
**Objective**: To reduce the initial set of articles to those likely to be topically related to Article A.

**Approach**:
1. **Vector Representation of Tags**: Convert tags into a vectorized format that can be quantitatively compared. Two common approaches are:
   - **Binary Encoding**: Create a binary vector for each article where each element represents a tag; the element is `1` if the article has the tag, otherwise `0`.
   - **TF-IDF Encoding**: If some tags are more informative than others, using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) can help by reducing the weight of tags that appear very frequently across all articles, thus highlighting more unique tags.

2. **Similarity Metric**: Use Jaccard similarity for binary vectors (since it's effective for comparing sets, like tags) or cosine similarity for TF-IDF vectors. Calculate the similarity between the vector for Article A and each article in your database.

3. **Filtering Threshold**: Set a threshold for similarity scores to filter out articles. This threshold can be determined experimentally; start with a moderate value and adjust based on the relevance of the retrieved articles.

**Tools & Libraries**:
- Python’s `scikit-learn` library provides functionalities for both vectorization (e.g., `CountVectorizer` for binary and `TfidfVectorizer` for TF-IDF) and calculating cosine similarity.

#### Embedding Similarity
**Objective**: To refine the selection of articles by comparing the contextual similarity based on embeddings.

**Approach**:
1. **Cosine Similarity**: Calculate the cosine similarity between the embedding of Article A and the embeddings of the articles filtered by tag-based similarity. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, making it a good choice for high-dimensional data like embeddings.

2. **Ranking Articles**: Rank the articles based on the cosine similarity scores. Higher scores indicate a closer match in the context or content of the articles.

**Tools & Libraries**:
- Use `numpy` or `scipy.spatial.distance` for efficient cosine similarity calculations.

### 4.2 Temporal Sorting
**Objective**: To order the selected articles in a chronological sequence to visualize how the story or topic developed over time.

**Approach**:
1. **Date Extraction**: Ensure that the publication date for each article is correctly parsed and standardized to a datetime format. This is crucial for accurate sorting.

2. **Sorting Mechanism**: Once articles are filtered and ranked based on similarity, sort them by their publication date. You might need to decide whether to use the creation, edited, or published date depending on which is most relevant to the accuracy and context of the timeline.

3. **Handling Ambiguities**: If two articles have the same date, additional criteria may be needed for sorting (e.g., article length, number of edits, etc.).

**Tools & Libraries**:
- Python’s `pandas` library can handle both the sorting of dates and any secondary sorting criteria effectively.

### Experiments and Considerations
- **Experiment with Different Thresholds and Metrics**: The thresholds for tag similarity and the choice of similarity metrics (Jaccard vs. cosine) can significantly affect the outcome. Experiment with these to find the optimal settings.
- **Evaluate Different Tagging Schemes**: The effectiveness of tag-based filtering can depend heavily on the quality of the tags. Consider experimenting with different methods of generating or improving tags.
- **Performance Optimization**: For large datasets, the retrieval mechanism needs to be optimized. Consider using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms for faster retrieval of similar embeddings.


Step 1: Date Extraction from Text
1.1 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Objective: Extract dates and possibly related events directly from the article text.
Tools & Techniques:
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Use NER models to identify date entities within the text. Many pre-trained NER models can recognize dates and are available in libraries like spaCy, NLTK, or via APIs like Google Cloud Natural Language or AWS Comprehend.
Custom Regex Patterns: Sometimes, NER might miss context-specific formats or relevant temporal expressions. Using regular expressions to capture common and context-specific date formats can supplement NER.
1.2 Contextual Date Parsing
Handling Relative Dates: Phrases like "yesterday" or "last week" need to be interpreted relative to the article's published or created date.
Tools: Libraries like dateparser or dateutil in Python can resolve these relative dates based on a reference date provided (e.g., the publication date).
Step 2: Link Events to Dates
2.1 Event Extraction
Objective: Identify key sentences or phrases that describe events.
Technique: Use a combination of NLP tasks:
Keyword or Phrase Extraction: Identify important keywords or phrases that often indicate events (e.g., inaugurated, attacked, signed).
Dependency Parsing: Use parsing to understand the relationship between dates and event-describing terms within sentences.
2.2 Association of Events with Dates
Mapping Events to Dates: Develop a system to link extracted events to their nearest extracted date or the explicitly mentioned date within the same sentence or paragraph.
