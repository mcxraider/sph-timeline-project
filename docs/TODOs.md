 
- Test generate_timeline with a multiple-article example to see if it returns consistent outputs for each article, not just the timeline.
  

- Tag improvements:
  - Country should include city, country. Eg (Johor, Malaysia) and not just johor

- Timeline enhancer should filter for irrelvant information. Eg if one tieline talking about china, the other talking about Malaysia



- Compare the performance of versions 1.0-pro and 1.5-pro specifically for generating the timeline.
- 
- Implement token function call using Vertex API

- Shrink timeline optimisation?

Once the full workflow is developed:
- Learn how to integrate this with Gradio.
- Move on to work on Advanced RAG!
