## Next Steps:

### Clean Up Code:
1. **Generate Pipeline**: 
   - Generate out the relevant articles using all OutputParsers.
2. **Change Outputs**:
   - Use prompts instead of OutputParsers.
3. **Article Generation**:
   - Only use one article for the generation, not the list.
4. **Good Coding Practices**:
   - Change code to show good coding practices and formatting of code to a `.py` script (i.e., if `__main__`, `__init__`).
5. **Python Environment Issues**:
   - Fix any Python environment issues.

### Timeline Generation:
- Try generating a timeline of events for each article in the selected articles.
- Use a prompt to combine these timelines to form one longer, possibly better timeline.
- Since having the `Article_id` for each event in the timeline, can do something with that to improve the contextual information of each event in the timeline.

2. **Watch CrewAI Tutorial**:
   - Utilize CrewAI to check the timeline for correctness.
